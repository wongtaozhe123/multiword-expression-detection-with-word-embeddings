remaining 10ml is then diluted again and the process repeated '], ['At the end of 5 dilutions this produces 50 tubes covering the dilution range of 1  10 through to 1  10000 '], ['The tubes are then

colonies are counted by eye  a procedure that takes a few moments and does not require a microscope as the colonies are typically a few millimetres across '], ['Most modern laboratories use a refinement of total plate count in which serial dilutions of the sample are vacuum filtered through purpose made membrane filters and these filters are themselves laid on nutrient medium within sealed plates '], ['The methodology is otherwise similar to conventional total plate counts '], ['Membranes have a printed millimetre grid printed on and can be reliably count a much greater number of

nutrient agar which is then poured into bottles which are then sealed and laid on their sides to produce a sloping agar surface '], ['Colonies that develop in the body of the medium can be counted by eye after incubation '], ['The total number of colonies is referred to as the Total Viable Count  TVC  '], ['The unit of measurement is cfu  ml  or colony forming units per millilitre  and relates to the original sample '], ['Calculation of this is a multiple of the counted number of colonies multiplied by the dilution used '], ['When samples show elevated levels of indicator bacteria  further

magnetohydrodynamic instability  leading to the design of the National Ignition Facility  Nova s successor '], ['Nova also generated considerable amounts of data on highdensity matter physics

surface of the pellet into a plasma  which explodes off the surface '], ['The remaining portion of the target is driven inwards due to Newton s Third Law  eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density '], ['The rapid blowoff also creates a shock wave that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel '], ['When it reaches the center of the fuel and meets the shock from the

with the right combination of features '], ['LLNL s history with the ICF program starts with physicist John Nuckolls  who predicted in 1972 that ignition could be achieved with laser energies about 1 kJ  while high gain would require energies around 1 MJ '], ['Although this sounds very low powered compared to modern machines  at the time it was just beyond the state of the art  and led to a number of programs to produce lasers in this power range '], ['Prior to the construction of Nova  LLNL had designed and built a series of everlarger lasers that explored the problems of basic ICF design '],

other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide  eg Antares laser  Los Alamos National Laboratory  or KrF  eg Nike laser  Naval Research Laboratory  '], ['Building large Nd  glass lasers had not been attempted before  and LLNL s early research focussed primarily on how to make these devices '], ['One problem was the homogeneity of the beams '], ['Even minor variations in intensity of the beams would result in selffocusing in the air and glass optics in a process known as Kerr lensing '], ['The resulting beam included small filaments of extremely high light intensity  so high it would damage the glass optics of the device '], ['This problem was solved in the Cyclops laser with the introduction of the spatial filtering technique '], ['Cyclops was followed by the Argus laser of greater power  which explored the problems of controlling more than one beam and illuminating a target more evenly '], ['All of this work culminated in the Shiva laser  a proofofconcept design for a high power system that included 20 separate laser amplifiers that were directed around the target to illuminate it '], ['It was during experiments with Shiva that another serious unexpected problem appeared '], ['The infrared light generated by the Nd  glass lasers was found to interact very strongly with the electrons in the plasma created during the initial heating through the process of stimulated Raman scattering '], ['This process  referred to as hot electron preheating  carried away a great amount of the laser s energy  and also caused the core of the target to heat before it reached maximum compression '], ['This meant that much less energy was being deposited in the center of the collapse  both due to the reduction in implosion energy  as well as the outward force of the heated core '], ['Although it was known that shorter wavelengths would reduce this problem  it had earlier been expected that the IR frequencies used in Shiva would be short enough '], ['This proved not to be the case '], ['A solution to this problem was explored in the form of efficient frequency multipliers  optical devices that combine several photons into one of higher energy  and thus frequency '], ['These devices were quickly introduced and tested experimentally on the OMEGA laser and others  proving effective '], ['Although the process is only about 50 efficient  and half the original laser power is lost  the resulting ultraviolet light couples much more efficiently to the target plasma and is much more effective in collapsing the target to high density '], ['With these solutions in hand  LLNL decided to build a device with the power needed to produce ignition conditions Design started in the late 1970s  with construction following shortly starting with the testbed Novette laser to validate the basic beamline and frequency multiplier design This was a time of repeated energy crises in the US and funding was not difficult to find given the large amounts of money available for alternative energy and nuclear weapons research '], ['During the initial construction phase  Nuckolls found an error in his calculations  and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr of TRW confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition '], ['The Nova design was then modified into a smaller design that added frequency conversion to 351 nm light  which would increase coupling efficiency '], ['The new Nova emerged as a system with ten laser amplifiers  or beamlines '], ['Each beamline consisted of a series of Nd  glass amplifiers separated by spatial filters and other optics for cleaning up the resulting beams '], ['Although techniques for folding the beamlines were known as early as Shiva  they were not well developed at this point in time '], ['Nova ended up with a single fold in its layout  and the laser bay containing the beamlines was long '], ['To the casual observer it appears to contain twenty long beamlines  but due to the fold each of the ten is actually almost long in terms of optical path length '], ['Prior to firing  the Nd  glass amplifiers are first pumped with a series of Xenon flash lamps surrounding them '], ['Some of the light produced by the lamps is captured in the glass  leading to a population inversion that allows for amplification via stimulated emission '], ['This process is quite inefficient  and only about 1 to 1  5 of the power fed into the lamps is actually turned into laser energy '], ['In order to produce the sort of laser power required for Nova  the lamps had to be very large  fed power from a large bank of capacitors located under the laser bay '], ['The flash also generates a large amount of heat which distorts the glass  requiring time for the lamps and glass to cool before they can be fired again '], ['This limits Nova to about six firings a day at the maximum '], ['Once pumped and ready for firing  a small pulse of laser light is fed into the beamlines '], ['The Nd  glass disks each dump additional power into the beam as it passes through them '], ['After passing through a number of amplifiers the light pulse is cleaned up in a spatial filter before being fed into another series of amplifiers '], ['At each stage additional optics were used to increase the diameter of the beam and allow the use of larger and larger amplifier disks '], ['In total  Nova contained fifteen amplifiers and five filters of increasing size in the beamlines  with an option to add an additional amplifier on the last stage  although it is not clear if these were used in practice '], ['From there all ten beams pass into the experiment area at one end of the laser bay '], ['Here a series of mirrors reflects the beams to impinge in the center of the bay from all angles '], ['Optical devices in some of the paths slow the beams so that they all reach the center at the same time  within about a picosecond   as some of the beams have longer paths to the center than others '], ['Frequency multipliers upconvert the light to green and blue  UV  just prior to entering the target chamber '], ['Nova is arranged so any remaining IR or green light is focused short of the center of the chamber '], ['The Nova laser as a whole was capable of delivering approximately 100 kilojoules of infrared light at 1054 nm  or 4045 kilojoules of frequency tripled light at 351 nm  the third harmonic of the Nd  Glass fundamental line at 1054 nm  in a pulse duration of about 2 to 4 nanoseconds and thus was capable of producing a UV pulse in the range of 16 trillion watts '], ['Research on Nova was focussed on the indirect drive approach  where the laser shine on the inside surface of a thin metal foil  typically made of gold  lead  or another highz metal '], ['When heated by the laser  the metal reradiates this energy as diffuse xrays  which are more efficient than UV at compressing the fuel pellet '], ['In order to emit xrays  the metal must be heated to very high temperatures  which uses up a considerable amount of the laser energy '], ['So while the compression is more efficient  the overall energy delivered to the target is nevertheless much smaller '], ['The reason for the xray conversion is not to improve energy delivery  but to smooth the energy profile  since the metal foil spreads out the heat somewhat  the anisotropies in the original laser are greatly reduced '], ['The foil shells  or hohlraums  are generally formed as small openended cylinders  with the laser arranged to shine in the open ends at an oblique angle in order to strike the inner surface '], ['In order to support the indirect drive research at Nova  a second experimental area was built past the main one  opposite the laser bay '], ['The system was arranged to focus all ten beams into two sets of five each  which passed into this second area and then into either end of the target chamber  and from there into the hohlraums '], ['Confusingly  the indirect drive approach was not made widely public until 1993 '], ['Documents from the era published in general science magazines and similar material either gloss over the issue  or imply that Nova was using the direct drive approach  lacking the hohlraum '], ['It was only during the design of NIF that the topic become public  so Nova was old news by that point '], ['As had happened with the earlier Shiva  Nova failed to meet expectations in terms of fusion output '], ['In this case the problem was tracked to instabilities that mixed the fuel during collapse and upset the formation and transmission of the shock wave '], ['The maximum fusion yield on NOVA was about 1013 neutrons per shot '], ['The problem was caused by Nova s inability to closely match the output energy of each of the beamlines  which meant that different areas of the pellet received different amounts of heating across its surface '], ['This led to hot spots on the pellet which were imprinted into the imploding plasma  seeding RayleighTaylor instabilities and thereby mixing the plasma so the center did not collapse uniformly '], ['Nevertheless  Nova remained a useful instrument even in its original form  and the main target chamber and beamlines were used for many years even after it was modified as outlined below '], ['A number of different techniques for smoothing the beams were attempted over its lifetime  both to improve Nova as well as better understand NIF '], ['These experiments added considerably not only to the understanding of ICF  but also to highdensity physics in general  and even the evolution of the galaxy and supernovas '], ['Shortly after completion of Nova  modifications were made to improve it as an experimental device '], ['One problem was that the experimental chamber took a long time to refit for another shot  longer than the time needed to cool down the lasers '], ['In order to improve utilization of the laser  a second experimental chamber was built past the original  with optics that combined the ten beamlines into two '], ['Nova had been built up against the older Shiva buildings  with the two experimental chambers back to back and the beamlines extending outward from the center target areas '], ['The Two Beam system was installed by passing the beamguides and related optics through the now unused Shiva experimental area and placing the smaller experimental chamber in Shiva s beam bay '], ['Nova s partial success  combined with other experimental numbers  prompted Department of Energy to request a custom military ICF facility they called the Laboratory Microfusion Facility  LMF  that could achieve fusion yield between 100 and 1000 MJ '], ['Based on the LASNEX computer models  it was estimated that LMF would require a driver of about 10 MJ  in spite of nuclear tests that suggested a higher power '], ['Building such a device was within the state of the art  but would be expensive  on the order of 1 billion '], ['LLNL returned a design with a 5 MJ 350 nm  UV  driver laser that would be able to reach about 200 MJ yield  which was enough to access the majority of the LMF goals '], ['The program was estimated to cost about 600 million FY 1989 dollars  and an additional 250 million to upgrade it to a full 1000 MJ if needed  and would grow to well over 1 billion if LMF was to meet all of the goals the DOE asked for '], ['Other labs also proposed their own LMF designs using other technologies '], ['Faced with this enormous project  in 1989  90 National Academy of Sciences conducted a second review of the US ICF efforts on behalf of the US Congress '], ['The report concluded that considering the extrapolations required in target physics and driver performance  as well as the likely 1 billion cost  the committee believes that an LMF ie a Laser Microfusion Facility with yields to one gigajoule is too large a step to take directly from the present program O'], ['Their report suggested that the primary goal of the program in the short term should be resolving the various issues related to ignition  and that a fullscale LMF should not be attempted until these problems were resolved '], ['The report was also critical of the gas laser experiments being carried out at LANL  and suggested they  and similar projects at other labs  be dropped '], ['The report accepted the LASNEX numbers and continued to approve an approach with laser energy around 10 MJ '], ['Nevertheless the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy requirements  and noted Indeed  if it did turn out that a 100MJ driver were required for ignition and gain  one would have to rethink the entire approach to  and rationale for  ICF '], ['In July 1992 LLNL responded to these suggestions with the Nova Upgrade  which would reuse the majority of the existing Nova facility  along with the adjacent Shiva facility '], ['The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept  with a driver of about 1 to 2 MJ '], ['The new design included a number of features that advanced the state of the art in the driver section  including the multipass design in the main amplifiers  and 18 beamlines  up from 10  that were split into 288 beamlets as they entered the target area in order to improve the uniformity of illumination '], ['The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines  one in the existing Nova beamline room  and the other in the older Shiva building next door  extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area '], ['The lasers would deliver about 500 TW in a 4 ns pulse '],

taking place from 1995 to 1999 '], ['For reasons that are not well recorded in the historical record  later in 1992 LLNL updated their Nova Upgrade proposal and stated that the existing Nova  Shiva buildings would no longer be able to contain the new system  and that a new building about three times as large would be needed '], ['From then on the plans evolved into the current National Ignition Facility '], ['Starting in the late 1980s a new method of creating very short but very high power laser pulses was developed  known as chirped pulse amplification  or CPA '], ['Starting in 1992  LLNL

responded over a period of time  not instantaneously  and very short pulses would not be strongly amplified '], ['Another problem was that the high power densities led to the same sorts of selffocusing problems that had caused problems in earlier designs  but at such a magnitude that even measures like spacial filtering would not be enough  in fact the power densities were high enough to cause filaments to form in air '], ['CPA avoids both of these problems by spreading out the laser pulse in time '], ['It does this by reflecting a relatively multichromatic  as compared to most lasers  pulse off a series of two diffraction gratings  which splits them spatially into different frequencies  essentially the same thing a simple prism does with visible light '], ['These individual frequencies have to travel different distances when reflected back into the beamline  resulting in the pulse being stretched out in time '], ['This longer pulse is fed into the amplifiers as normal  which now have time to respond normally '], ['After amplification the beams are sent into a second pair of gratings in reverse to recombine them into a single short pulse with high power '], ['In order to avoid filamentation or damage to the optical elements  the entire end of the beamline is placed in a large vacuum chamber '], ['Although Petawatt was instrumental in advancing the practical basis for the concept of fast ignition fusion  by the time it was operational as a proofofconcept device  the decision to move ahead with NIF had already been taken '], ['Further work on the fast ignition approach continues  and will potentially reach a level of development far in advance of NIF at HiPER  an experimental system under development in the European Union '], ['If successful  HiPER

many ways '], ['This loan was controversial  as the only other operational laser at LLNL at the time  Beamlet  a single experimental beamline for NIF   had recently been sent to Sandia National

            "bacteriological water analysis is a method of analysing water to estimate the numbers of bacteria present and if needed to find out what sort of bacteria they are it is a microbiological analytical procedure which uses samples of water and from these samples determines the concentration of bacteria it is then possible to draw inferences about the suitability of the water for use from these concentrations this process is used for example to routinely confirm that water is safe for human consumption or that bathing and recreational waters are safe to use the interpretation and the action trigger levels for different waters vary depending on the use made of the water very stringent levels applying to drinking water whilst more relaxed levels apply to marine bathing waters where much lower volumes of water are expected to be ingested by users the common feature of all these routine screening procedures is that the primary analysis is for indicator organisms rather than the pathogens that might cause concern indicator organisms are bacteria such as nonspecific coliforms escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa that are very commonly found in the human or animal gut and which if detected may suggest the presence of sewage indicator organisms are used because even when a person is infected with a more pathogenic bacteria they will still be excreting many millions times more indicator organisms than pathogens it is therefore reasonable to surmise that if indicator organism levels are low then pathogen levels will be very much lower or absent judgements as to suitability of water for use are based on very extensive precedents and relate to the probability of any sample population of bacteria being able to be infective at a reasonable statistical level of confidence analysis is usually performed using culture biochemical and sometimes optical methods when indicator organisms levels exceed preset triggers specific analysis for pathogens may then be undertaken and these can be quickly detected where suspected using specific culture methods or molecular biology because the analysis is always based on a very small sample taken from a very large volume of water all methods rely on statistical principles one of the oldest methods is called the multiple tube method in this method a measured subsample perhaps 10ml is diluted with 100ml of sterile growth medium and an aliquot of 10ml is then decanted into each of ten tubes the remaining 10ml is then diluted again and the process repeated at the end of 5 dilutions this produces 50 tubes covering the dilution range of 1 10 through to 1 10000 the tubes are then incubated at a preset temperature for a specified time and at the end of the process the number of tubes with growth in is counted for each dilution statistical tables are then used to derive the concentration of organisms in the original sample this method can be enhanced by using indicator medium which changes colour when acid forming species are present and by including a tiny inverted tube in each sample tube this inverted tube catches any gas produced the production of gas at 37 deg celsius is a strong indication of the presence of escherichia coli an atp test is the process of rapidly measuring active microorganisms in water through detection of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate or atp atp is a molecule found only in and around living cells and as such it gives a direct measure of biological concentration and health atp is quantified by measuring the light produced through its reaction with the naturallyoccurring firefly enzyme luciferase using a luminometer the amount of light produced is directly proportional to the amount of biological energy present in the sample 2nd generation atp tests are specifically designed for water wastewater and industrial applications where for the most part samples contain a variety of components that can interfere with the atp assay the plate count method relies on bacteria growing a colony on a nutrient medium so that the colony becomes visible to the naked eye and the number of colonies on a plate can be counted to be effective the dilution of the original sample must be arranged so that on average between 10 and 100 colonies of the target bacterium are grown fewer than 10 colonies makes the interpretation statistically unsound whilst greater than 100 colonies often results in overlapping colonies and imprecision in the count to ensure that an appropriate number of colonies will be generated several dilutions are normally cultured the laboratory procedure involves making serial dilutions of the sample 1 10 1 100 1 1000 etc in sterile water and cultivating these on nutrient agar in a dish that is sealed and incubated typical media include plate count agar for a general count or macconkey agar to count gramnegative bacteria such as e coli typically one set of plates is incubated at 22â°c and for 24 hours and a second set at 37â°c for 24 hours the composition of the nutrient usually includes reagents that resist the growth of nontarget organisms and make the target organism easily identified often by a colour change in the medium some recent methods include a fluorescent agent so that counting of the colonies can be automated at the end of the incubation period the colonies are counted by eye a procedure that takes a few moments and does not require a microscope as the colonies are typically a few millimetres across most modern laboratories use a refinement of total plate count in which serial dilutions of the sample are vacuum filtered through purpose made membrane filters and these filters are themselves laid on nutrient medium within sealed plates the methodology is otherwise similar to conventional total plate counts membranes have a printed millimetre grid printed on and can be reliably count a much greater number of colonies under a binocular microscope when the analysis is looking for bacterial species that grow poorly in air the initial analysis is done by mixing serial dilutions of the sample in liquid nutrient agar which is then poured into bottles which are then sealed and laid on their sides to produce a sloping agar surface colonies that develop in the body of the medium can be counted by eye after incubation the total number of colonies is referred to as the total viable count tvc  the unit of measurement is cfu ml or colony forming units per millilitre and relates to the original sample calculation of this is a multiple of the counted number of colonies multiplied by the dilution used when samples show elevated levels of indicator bacteria further analysis is often undertaken to look for specific pathogenic bacteria species commonly investigated in the temperate zone include salmonella typhi and salmonella typhimurium depending on the likely source of contamination investigation may also extend to organisms such as cryptosporidium spp in tropical areas analysis of vibrio cholerae is also routinely undertaken macconkey agar is culture medium designed to grow gramnegative bacteria and stain them for lactose fermentation it contains bile salts to inhibit most grampositive bacteria  crystal violet dye which also inhibits certain grampositive bacteria  neutral red dye which stains microbes fermenting lactose  lactose and peptone alfred theodore macconkey developed it while working as a bacteriologist for the royal commission on sewage disposal in the united kingdom endo medium contains peptone lactose dipotassium phosphate agar sodium sulfite basic fuchsin and was originally developed for the isolation of salmonella typhi but is now commonly used in water analysis as in macconkey agar coliform organisms ferment the lactose and the colonies become red nonlactosefermenting organisms produce clear colourless colonies against the faint pink background of the medium mfc medium is a medium used in membrane filtration which contains selective and differential agents these include rosolic acid to inhibit bacterial growth in general except for faecal coliforms bile salts inhibit nonenteric bacteria and aniline blue indicates the ability of faecal coliforms to ferment lactose to acid that causes a ph change in the medium tyea medium contains tryptone yeast extract common salt

wandering when a ghost named gawain asks him to father a child to his widow orlene with whom norton eventually falls in love gawain then asks gaea the incarnation of nature to make the child in his own likeness so his bloodline would continue unfortunately the child ends up dead due to a disease that runs in gawain s family orlene then commits suicide feeling depressed about the disastrous results of his affair with orlene norton is approached by gawain again who offers norton the position of time chronos  where he must rule over all earthly aspects of time gawain explains to norton that chronos lives backwards in time until the moment of the birth or conception it is never made clear of the office holder s previous self who is still living forwards the ghost baits norton explaining to him that by living backwards he can continue to see orlene since she is still alive in the past norton accepts and gawain leads him to the spot where the future office holder of time norton s predecessor will pass the hourglass onto norton norton immediately starts literally living life backwards in time though he can temporarily go forward in order to interact with others however when he is living backwards he is not visible to mortals norton experiments with his hourglass recognized by all the incarnations as being the most powerful magical device in the world to halt and or reverse time travel many millions of years into the earth s past and work with the incarnation of fate who needs his hourglass to help fix tangles in her threads of fate because norton lives backwards in time his past is everyone else s future making him an isolated character even among the other incarnations he also realises that this will make it impossible to have a relationship with the forwardliving orlene he does however have an affair with clotho the youngest aspect of fate this is both awkward and intriguing to norton since her past is his future residing at his new residence in purgatory norton is then visited by satan who informs norton that while he can travel anywhere in time with his hourglass he cannot leave earth satan claims to have the power to travel the whole universe since evil permeates all of reality and gives norton some samples of this ability by having him travel to other planets where satan claims time flows backwards allowing norton to live normally and to get involved in both a space opera bat durston and the bems and an epic fantasy adventure satan offers norton the ability to have that power if norton will grant satan a favor to go back in time 20 years and save a man from committing suicide norton goes back in time to check out this young man but after consulting with the other incarnations he is informed that this man is the current office holder of the incarnation of death thanatosin other words zane from the previous novel and that it is zane s attempted suicide that brought him to that position this man is needed as thanatos in order to protect his girlfriend luna kaftan from satan s mischief so she can go into politics and fulfill a prophecy of thwarting satan however a relic satan had given norton turned out to be a demon in disguise when norton went back in time the demon disembarked a few years in the past to prevent luna from going into politics the demon gives an incumbent politician an antidote to keep him alive so luna does nt take his place  due to some of the limitations of the hourglass intercepting this demon is difficult but norton eventually manages to stop it not giving up satan tries one more time by trapping norton on one of the other planets he had an adventure on not sure how to get back home norton starts toying with the hourglass traveling all the way back to the beginning of the observable universe and all the way to its end from the big bang to the point where all matter became trapped in black holes and realizes that since the incarnations magic does not extend beyond earth his adventures on other planets were illusions created by satan and that norton had in fact never left earth norton then finds out that the demon that created the illusion had been attached to him and once again disembarked at a point in the past two years after the events of the first book to begin a campaign to discredit luna so she does nt run for office norton then goes back in time to this point and uses his hourglass to show the world all the bad things that will happen if luna does nt get elected as norton is no longer fooled by satan s illusions satan stops trying to exploit him time s hourglass is recognized as the most powerful single item any incarnation possesses and it is all chronos needs it has an incredibly large variety of functions all controlled by time s will it can move chronos forward or backward in time reverse his personal time to allow him to interact with others and pause time for himself or his local area which is not a true stasis as most of the world continues as normal how this syncs up is never explained it is simply magic  he can reverse time temporarily in an area which simply rewinds a scene without the mortal participants being aware of it which allows him to choose another course for it he can also choose to put the entire world into stasis or even reverse time for the entire world which he is forced to do at one point in addition time s hourglass is also his method of travel by selectively moving himself slightly out of sync with the earth s rotation and orbit as he travels in time he can use it to travel in space this travel is of course failsafed to not allow him to end up in deep space or inside a wall or the earth itself time s hourglass cannot be broken or lost as any attempt to leave it behind will simply cause it to float at the same relative distance it was released it can however be folded up for easy storage though it still functions just as well much like the other incarnations time s robe protects him from any kind of physical harm like the other incarnations he is immortal and cannot be killed before it is time to pass on the office anything attempting to attack him would be immediately aged into oblivion upon contact his robe is also the default area for his personal time flow though he can of course expand it to bring other things along with him when he travels while not an official device of time sning is a valuable companion to norton throughout his career a demonic though benign creature it takes the form of a ring in the shape of a snake where it gets the name norton gave it standing for snake ring  while not omnipotent sning has an incredible amount of information and appears to be able to learn many things about creatures just by touching them it can respond to any question asked of it by squeezing the wearer s finger one squeeze for yes two for no three for uncertainty complex answers or inability to answer for example if the asker foolishly poses a non yes no question  it can also answer with squeezes representing a number though sning is actually quite bad at math much to its embarrassment in addition it is capable of coming alive briefly scouting an area and reporting back while alive it is approximately six inches long though it is shown that he can grow and also poisonous its poison is strong enough to make a creature the size of a man sick for several hours but not to kill sning has a long and complex history originally belonging to mym the prince fated to become the incarnation of war he later gave it to orb the eventual incarnation of nature when they were forced to part who gave it to her daughter orlene the eventual incarnation of good she eventually bestowed it to norton as a gift despite being in the possession of four major incarnations sning was actually only named by norton and he was the only one to use him during his actual time as an incarnation time because of his nature is the only incarnation that is actually required to pass along his office at an exact schedule though time can travel to any period he cannot actually interact with the world outside the span of his own lifetime thus as he lives backwards when his lifetime is up he must pass on the office to an heir though he has some ability to plan the transfer the exact timing and the fact that he lives backwards means he has very little ability to actually enact it he is forced to simply leave the hourglass and hope whoever he has set up to take it does so the hourglass will entice those around it to pick it up for there must be an incarnation of time but it does not always go smoothly there is one instance mentioned where the proposed new officeholder refused the position and it fell to a nearby sevenyearold boy who happened to pick up the hourglass again though the position would appear to be gender neutral it is traditionally held by a male time is responsible for scheduling all human events to make sure everything runs smoothly and the natural laws like cause and effect are honored he works most closely with fate helping her to fix crossed threads caused by human error or simply random chance he also schedules notable births and deaths important events in people s lives and in history and makes sure the flow of time remains stable when it is bent as it is by his allowance that the other incarnations are also capable of local timestops he is also responsible for guaranteeing that the course of history flows as it should as time he is immune to paradox and to the possibility of multiple futures should actions occur to change the course of the future his memories will change with it however typically his original memories are accepted as the desirable ones as one of his major tasks is to make sure it does not get changed around without adequate reason this is of course why he lives backwards he would be unable to properly deal with making the future happen as planned if he was unaware of the plan jackie cassada in the library journal review says that amid weight and often convoluted speculations about the nature of good and evil time and space and magic and science anthony s irrepressible humor asserts itself in unexpected ways far from being grim or even allegoricalthis sequel to on a pale horse will appeal to anthony s large readership  bodufenvalhuge sidi or assayyidhu bodufenvalhugey seedhee 1888 1970  was a muchcelebrated maldivian intellectual and writer bodufenvalhuge sidi born on 19 may 1888 as hussain elhussaini was bodufenvalhuge don manike and mohamed kuda sidi s son he was a poet and also one time chief justice he married eight ladies and had five surviving children from four of these marriages his first wife was bodugalhuge aysha didi daughter of bodugaluge lhatuttu didi among his descendants are ahmed mujuthaba and mohamed mustafa who are both prominent in maldivian administration and politics bodufenvalhuge sidi spent several years of his youth in addu atoll with his maternal relatives addu atoll was the main centre of learning in the maldives at that time the turn of the century he was educated there by a wellknown master and relative elhageã¬ abdullahi didi son of ganduvaru hasan didi also known as don beyya of meedhu bodufenvalhuge sidi was credited with many of the developments in maldivian poetry in the20th century he was the last major poet to write in the maldivian poetic style called raivaru and one of the first poets to write in the style called lhen bodufenvalhuge sidi s early poems were mainly political satire in 1925 an attempt was made to depose sultan mohamed shamsuddin iii in favour of prince abdulla imaduddin son of the deposed king siri kula sundhura katthiri bavana sultan mohamed imaduddine vi  the deposed king was exiled in egypt while abdulla imaduddine was on a visit to male from egypt the attempt was foiled in february 1925 and abdulla imaduddine was deported to egypt the other conspirators were banished to various atolls of the maldives bodufenvalhuge sidi the most welleducated and widely respected of the conspirators was accused of masterminding the plot he denied the charge and claimed that he advised strongly against the timing and the modus operandi in the plot bodufenvalhuge sidi engaged in hunger strike and refused to answer any questions saying that he had done nothing wrong after he had agreed to take his food he insisted that it nust be delivered from his residence he was successful in having this wish granted and at every meal time his brotherinlaw beruge yoosuf fulhu turned up with his meals and waited there while he ate bodufenvalhuge sidi was implying that he did not trust the maldivian authorities usually the authorities meted out summary justice in cases such as that the victim would be taken outside and given a good flogging with a catoninetails until he was covered in blood then lonumirus chilli paste would be applied to his wounds and he would be banished to a remote island in bodufenvalhuge sidi s case they were reluctant to do so because the british had become aware of the situation the maldives was then a british protectorate even though the british were bund by a treaty not to interfere in the internal affairs of the maldives bodufenvalhuge sidi was banished to hulhudheli in a southern atoll many of hismaternal relatives from addu atoll regularly stopped at that island for provisions and water on their way to and from male  the authorities then became suspicious and decided to send him to maamakunudhu the remotest of the northern islands in exile in maamakunudu island sidi continued to pursue his literary work and wrote much of his poetry it was there that he adopted his pen name of himaarul qowm or donkey of the nation he distributed his poetry then banned by the government to his associates in male through an exwife of his maavaa kileygefaanu ganduvaru goma and his sister bodufenvalhuge don didi bodufenvalhuge sidi remained on maamakunudu island for eight years until he was pardoned in a general amnesty following the forced abdication of king shamsuddin upon arrival in male he was appointed chief justice he was also appointed to the council of regency that ruled in the absence of a sultan after bodufenvalhuge sidi returned to male  he continued to write poetry and a few novelsand other books he was the last known person with a working knowledge of the older maldive script called dhives akuru assayyid bodufenvalhuge sidi was one of the very few maldivian people of modern times who understood the nowforgotten ancient divehi letters in which parts of royal grants warrants and deeds were written he learnt this ancient dhivehi writing systems in addu atoll until early in the twentieth century all government correspondence to and from addu atoll was written using these ancient divehi letters apart from a stint in politics as the minister of education bodufenvalhuge sidi remained in the legal ecclesiastical professions his literary work gradually became less radical and moreconventional with age bodufenvalhuge sidi died in male on 2 june 1970 best known among his novels were dillygey ibrahim didi ge vaahaka and maa makunudu bodu isa ge vaahaka he also published a treatise on maldive poetry called divehi lhen hedumuge masaikaiyterikamuge ran taraadu in 1959 during sultan mohammed farid s reign former prime minister and later president ibrahim nasir expressed a wish to have a book written about the former maldivian script which by that time was largely ignored by maldivians thus he contacted assayyid bodufenvalhuge sidi who swiftly obliged and wrote dhivehi akuru by means of this small book bodufenvalhuge sidi 18881970 wanted to clearly show the fact that in ancient times maldivians were writing from left to right in their own script hence divehi akuru is perhaps the only book ever written in täna that opens from the left side the last chapter of this book shows a text where the divehi akuru are coming along with arabic script as the reader acquainted with maldivian writing can see this book is volume 1 evvana bai  perhaps bodufenvalhuge sidi had the intention of publishing a second or perhaps even a third volume on the subject but unfortunately this important maldivian learned man died before being able to do so even though hcp bell did a very careful and thorough research on the maldivian documents prime minister ibrahim nasir s intention was to have a book on the ancient script of the maldives written by a maldivian prime minister nasir s request to bodufenvalhuge sidi was done in order to clarify hcp bell s misinterpretations no matter how few a staunch maldivian nationalist nasir took this issue as a matter of national pride present day members of maldivian cultural institutions are aware of the lacunae in bell s research and of bodufenvalhuge sidi s valuable contribution to mend matters but little has been done to correct those inaccuracies still hcp bell s broad and valuable contributions to the study of the maldivian language and scripts should not be underestimated  james david caldwell jr or buddy caldwell born may 20 1946  is the democratic attorney

versions of this remake retell the story of dracula s resurrection in 1691 followers of dracula perform a ritual to revive him at the start of the game the music for the x68000 game contains a variety of new arrangements of familiar tunes from the series as well as brand new compositions altogether the familiar songs include vampire killer and wicked child from the original castlevania bloody tears from castlevania ii simon s quest and theme of simon belmont from super castlevania iv before each game the player is given a choice between three different sound modules the x68000 s fm synthesizer midi roland la mt32 cm32l cm64 and midi roland gs sc55 sc33 sc155 cm300 cm500  while the soundtrack will remain the same throughout the game regardless of which sound module is chosen the instrumentation may vary and some songs will be arranged slightly differently såta fujimori staff composer for the konami corporation in japan performed all new arrangements of the soundtrack for castlevania chronicles arrange mode while many songs remain very similar to their akumajo dracula x68000 counterparts except with studio recorded live synth and other live instrumentation a handful of songs are given a techno feel some of these songs include vampire killer which now contains pieces of prologue and stalker from castlevania thrashard in the cave which is more ambient than its original version and wicked child in the japanese chronicles unlike the us and european versions the sound hardware selection screen automatically appears before starting a game on original mode just as it did in akumajå dracula x68000  a code must be entered to reach it in either mode in the us and european versions while the japanese version only requires one to be entered in arrange mode o while the original mode presented on chronicles is otherwise identical to the x68000 game there are a few limitations since it is emulated on different hardware one noticeable difference is the brief loading times that now appear before boss fights and stages the other drawback is the lack of an internal clock on the playstation the original game utilized the x68000 s internal time and date settings the time on the clock tower during the boss fight on stage 15 would reflect the x68000 s current time and the color scheme used on the painting in stage 21 would reflect one of the four seasons according to the computer s current date on the playstation game each time the system is turned on the time and date have to be manually adjusted only after a hidden extra option menu is accessed by inputting an altered version of the konami code during regular gameplay there are a few noticeable changes between the japanese release and the us european release of chronicles the marionettes on stage 17 cry out yamete stop in japanese and omae wa dare who are you in japanese when attacked in akumajå dracula x68000 and the japanese chronicles for localization purposes they are silent other than when they are destroyed in the us and european versions audiowise the japanese version of chronicles had slowdown issues with the music playback these were fixed for the us and european releases lastly exclusive to arrange mode on the us and european versions the player can save the game at stage 24 the battle with dracula  ign rated the playstation release 78 saying it did not quite measure up with later titles but was still a lot of fun gamespot gave that same release a 61 saying it lacked replay value and was graphically outdated  cause and effect is the 16th episode

standards of the united methodist church along with the articles of religion and the standard sermons of john wesley the united methodist church adopted the confession of faith in 1968 when the methodist church merged with the evangelical united brethren church to form the united methodist church the confession of faith covers much of the same ground as the articles of religion but it is shorter and the language is more contemporary the confession of faith also contains an article on the judgment and future state derived from the augsburg confession which had not been present in the methodist articles of religion  see articles of religion methodist for the 25 articles  the confession of faith of the evangelical united brethren church 6bibliographical note the text of the confession of faith is identical to that of its original in the discipline of the evangelical united brethren church 1963   article igod we believe in the one true holy and living god eternal spirit who is creator sovereign and preserver of all things visible and invisible he is infinite in power wisdom justice goodness and love and rules with gracious regard for the wellbeing and salvation of men to the glory of his name we believe the one god reveals himself as the trinity father son and holy spirit distinct but inseparable eternally one in essence and power article iijesus christ we believe in jesus christ truly god and truly man in whom the divine and human natures are perfectly and inseparably united he is the eternal word made flesh the only begotten son of the father born of the virgin mary by the power of the holy spirit as ministering servant he lived suffered and died on the cross he was buried rose from the dead and ascended into heaven to be with the father from whence he shall return he is eternal savior and mediator who intercedes for us and by him all men will be judged article iiithe holy spirit we believe in the holy spirit who proceeds from and is one in being with the father and the son he convinces the world of sin of righteousness and of judgment he leads men through faithful response to the gospel into the fellowship of the church he comforts sustains and empowers the faithful and guides them into all truth article ivthe holy bible we believe the holy bible old and new testaments reveals the word of god so far as it is necessary for our salvation it is to be received through the holy spirit as the true rule and guide for faith and practice whatever is not revealed in or established by the holy scriptures is not to be made an article of faith nor is it to be taught as essential to salvation article vthe church we believe the christian church is the community of all true believers under the lordship of christ we believe it is one holy apostolic and catholic it is the redemptive fellowship in which the word of god is preached by men divinely called and the sacraments are duly administered according to christ s own appointment under the discipline of the holy spirit the church exists for the maintenance of worship the edification of believers and the redemption of the world article vithe sacraments we believe the sacraments ordained by christ are symbols and pledges of the christian s profession and of god s love toward us they are means of grace by which god works invisibly in us quickening strengthening and confirming our faith in him two sacraments are ordained by christ our lord namely baptism and the lord s supper we bel ieve baptism signifies entrance into the household of faith and is a symbol of repentance and inner cleansing from sin a representation of the new birth in christ jesus and a mark of christian discipleship we believe children are under the atonement of christ and as heirs of the kingdom of god are acceptable subjects for christian baptism children of believing parents through baptism become the special responsibility of the church they should be nurtured and led to personal acceptance of christ and by profession of faith confirm their baptism we believe the lord s supper is a representation of our redemption a memorial of the sufferings and death of christ and a token of love and union which christians have with christ and with one another those who rightly worthily and in faith eat the broken bread and drink the blessed cup partake of the body and blood of christ in a spiritual manner until he comes article viisin and free will we believe man is fallen from righteousness and apart from the grace of our lord jesus christ is destitute of holiness and inclined to evil except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god in his own strength without divine grace man cannot do good works pleasing and acceptable to god we believe however man influenced and empowered by the holy spirit is responsible in freedom to exercise his will for good article viiireconciliation through christ we believe god was in christ reconciling the world to himself the offering christ freely made on the cross is the perfect and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the whole world redeeming man from all sin so that no other satisfaction is required article ixjustification and regeneration we believe we are never accounted righteous before god through our works or merit but that penitent sinners are justified or accounted righteous before god only by faith in our lord jesus christ we believe regeneration is the renewal of man in righteousness through jesus christ by the power of the holy spirit whereby we are made partakers of the divine nature and experience newness of life by this new birth the believer becomes reconciled to god and is enabled to serve him with the will and the affections we believe although we have experienced regeneration it is possible to depart from grace and fall into sin and we may even then by the grace of god be renewed in righteousness article xgood works we believe good works are the necessary fruits of faith and follow regeneration but they do not have the virtue to remove our sins or to avert divine judgment we believe good works pleasing and acceptable to god in christ spring from a true and living faith for through and by them faith is made evident article xisanctification and christian perfection we believe sanctification is the work of god s grace through the word and the spirit by which those who have been born again are cleansed from sin in their thoughts words and acts and are enabled to live in accordance with god s will and to strive for holiness without which no one will see the lord entire sanctification is a state of perfect love righteousness and true holiness which every regenerate believer may obtain by being delivered from the power of sin by loving god with all the heart soul mind and strength and by loving one s neighbor as one s self through faith in jesus christ this gracious gift may be received in this life both gradually and instantaneously and should be sought earnestly by every child of god we believe this experience does not deliver us from the infirmities ignorance and mistakes common to man nor from the possibilities of further sin the christian must continue on guard against spiritual pride and seek to gain victory over every temptation to sin he must respond wholly to the will of god so that sin will lose its power over him and the world the flesh and the devil are put under his feet thus he rules over these enemies with watchfulness through the power of the holy spirit article xiithe judgment and the future state we believe all men stand under the righteous judgment of jesus christ both now and in the last day we believe in the resurrection of the dead the righteous to life eternal and the wicked to endless condemnation article xiiipublic worship we believe divine worship is the duty and privilege of man who in the presence of god bows in adoration humility and dedication we believe divine worship is essential to the life of the church and that the assembling of the people of god for such worship is necessary to christian fellowship and spiritual growth we believe the order of public worship need not be the same in all places but may be modified by the church according to circumstances and the needs of men it should be in a language and form understood by the people consistent with the holy scriptures to the edification of all and in accordance with the order and discipline of the church article xivthe lord s day we believe the lord s day is divinely ordained for private and public worship for rest from unnecessary work and should be devoted to spiritual improvement christian fellowship and service it is commemorative of our lord s resurrection and is an emblem of our eternal rest it is essential to the permanence and growth of the christian church and important to the welfare of the civil community article xvthe christian and property we believe god is the owner of all things and that the individual holding of property is lawful and is a sacred trust under god private property is to be used for the manifestation of christian love and liberality and to support the church s mission in the world all forms of property whether private corporate or public are to be held in solemn trust and used responsibly for human good under the sovereignty of god article xvicivil government we believe civil government derives its just powers from the sovereign god as christians we recognize the governments under whose protection we reside and believe such governments should be based on and be responsible for the recognition of human rights under god we believe war and bloodshed are contrary to the gospel and spirit of christ we believe it is the duty of christian citizens to give moral strength and purpose to their respective governments through sober righteous and godly living  daphne moon crane born september 1971 is a fictional character on the american television sitcom frasier

best known for his work in antiwar and gay rights advocacy david benjamin mixner was born on august 16 1946 near the town of elmer in southern new jersey his father ben worked on a corporate farm and his mother mary worked shifts at a local glass factory and later took a job as a bookkeeper for the local john deere dealership david has two older siblings patsy mixner annison and melvin mixner mixner attended daretown elementary school then woodstown high school where he got involved in the civil rights movement by participating in picketing and sending his own money to martin luther king jr in his bestselling memoir stranger among friends mixner explains that his parents were livid over his involvement in the civil rights movement claiming his activism embarrassed them when mixner told them he wanted to go south during the summer of 1963 after following the events in birmingham alabama his parents forbade him in the fall of 1964 mixner enrolled at arizona state university in tempe arizona where he soon became heavily involved in civil rights and antiwar activism including helping to organize protests against a speech by general william westmoreland prompted by an article he read in the arizona republic about city garbage workers who were seeking the right to unionize in the fall of 1966 mixner organized from start to finish the first of many protests he would organize over the next thirty years mixner rallied hundreds of workers students and professors and led a march on city hall although the city successfully broke the strike the workers eventually earned the right to unionize mixner also experienced his first samesex relationship at asu with a man whom he refers to as kit in his memoirs a year into their relationship kit was killed in an automobile accident mixner did not attend the funeral and kit s parents never discovered that their son was gay soon after kit s death mixner decided to transfer to the university of maryland in order to be closer to washington dc where he would be able to get more involved in antiwar protests mixner found himself much more interested in activism than in pursuing a college degree while at maryland mixner was a grassroots organizer for the 1967 march on the pentagon which was later captured in norman mailer s armies of the night later that year mixner dropped out of college and began working for the presidential campaign of eugene mccarthy one of mixner s first assignments was organizing the minnesota operation helping mccarthy win the minnesota caucus defeating incumbent president lyndon b johnson later mixner and other members of mccarthy s campaign team went to georgia to help select an alternative delegation to send to the national convention in chicago challenging governor lestor maddox s handpicked delegation which included only seven africanamericans in the 117 person delegation the georgia democratic party forum which sought to challenge maddox s delegation held its own convention in macon where congressman john conyers dmi keynoted their convention before turning over the floor to julian bond the first africanamerican elected to the georgia legislature who would later become chairman of the naacp at the 1968 democratic national convention in chicago mixner was beaten by police during the protests held outside the convention center after humphrey claimed the nomination mixner began seeking out new outlets for his activism he soon befriended doris kearns goodwin who introduced mixner to senator ted kennedy who would become a lifelong friend in early 1969 mixner was invited to join the delegate selection committee which had been created during the 1968 democratic national convention although mixner s appointment turned out to be a mistake as senator fred r harris of oklahoma was supposed to invite mixner to join the less powerful rules committee he nonetheless made his mark on the twentyeight member body which included warren christopher who would later become secretary of state senator birch bayh of indiana senator harold hughes of iowa senator adlai stevenson iii of illinois and senator george mcgovern of south dakota who served as the committee s chairman by virtue of his inadvertent inclusion on the delegate selection committee mixner served as his generation s lone voice and he intended the use the platform to raise the issue of the violence at the previous year s convention when senator kennedy a close friend of chicago mayor richard j daley and the party s frontrunner for the 1972 presidential nomination took the witness stand mixner used the opportunity to ask kennedy if he would publicly condemn both the tactics used by the chicago police and the mayor for his involvement kennedy dodged the question subsequently adlai stevenson iii sought to exclude mixner from a committee meeting in chicago where mayor daley was scheduled to testify mcgovern called mixner asking him not to attend but mixner refused when he arrived for the meeting drawing the ire of senator stevenson mcgovern offered him a compromise promising to ask daley to apologize for the violence and offer all those arrested amnesty if mixner agreed to stay quiet the resulting exchange between mcgovern and daley included daley s insistence that if people violate the law they should accept the consequences of the law the mcgovern commission which had set out to reform the presidential nomination process in order to avoid a repeat of the 1968 convention eventually issued its recommendations including the requirement that all delegates be directly elected by the people eviscerating the power of political bosses to control the nomination process mixner s most significant contribution to the antivietnam war effort was his role as one of the head organizers of the moratorium to end the war in vietnam the idea was prompted by jerome grossman a massachusetts businessman active in the peace movement grossman proposed to sam brown a close friend of mixner that they set aside a day in 1969 where business as usual would come to a halt essentially engaging in a strike against everything brown decided that the word moratorium would be less threatening than strike to middleclass americans and set to work setting aside october 15 1969 as the day of the moratorium brown soon enlisted the help of mixner david hawk another young activist and marge sklencar who they knew from the mccarthy campaign brown mixner hawk and sklencar then set about organizing the event in september 1969 shortly before the moratorium mixner headed to martha s vineyard to meet with fellow activists many of whom had also worked on the mccarthy campaign among those in attendance was bill clinton who had been invited by one of mixner s friends at the time clinton was studying at oxford on a rhodes scholarship attending the martha s vineyard retreat with fellow rhodes scholars rick stearns and strobe talbott mixner and clinton were fast friends and mixner would play a significant role twentythree years later in getting the lgbt community to support clinton as the date of the moratorium approached it began gathering a great deal of momentum with time life and newsweek magazines featuring it in cover stories when clinton subsequently visited the headquarters of the moratorium and saw what he would be missing by being in london on october 15 he suggested to mixner that he organize a parallel protest at oxford this protest in which about a thousand people gathered in front of the american embassy in london would later be a significant issue in his presidential campaign with president george h bush telling larry king on cnn in october 1992 maybe i m oldfashioned but to go to a foreign country and demonstrate against your own country when your sons and daughters are dying halfway around the world i am sorry but i think that is wrong the moratorium drew millions of people throughout the country who gathered in public places and read the names of the soldiers killed in vietnam aloud the day was capped off by a march at the washington monument where coretta scott king the widow of martin luther king jr spoke about her late husband s passion for ending the war in 1976 mixner began the process of coming out of the closet and soon thereafter was a founding member of the municipal elections committee of los angeles mecla  the nation s first gay and lesbian political action committee at the time very few candidates were willing to accept donations from openly gay individuals or gayaffiliated organizations at the time mixner was also serving as the campaign manager for tom bradley the mayor of los angeles who was seeking reelection so while he worked to raise funds for mecla his involvement was kept secret because of the potential for his sexuality to become an issue in bradley s campaign soon after bradley won reelection easily mixner turned his focus to fighting proposition 6 an initiative placed on the california ballot by orange county state senator john briggs that would make it illegal for gays and lesbians to be schoolteachers similar initiatives had recently passed throughout the country when mixner turned his focus to fighting proposition 6 creating the no on 6 organization to fight it through the process he would publicly come out of the closet mixner and his lover peter scott secured a meeting

pro peace mixner envisioned finding five thousand americans who would take a year out of their lives to walk across america to advocate for disarmament holding rallies throughout the country the great peace march for global nuclear disarmament which mixner would later call his biggest political failure and his biggest regret ultimately left los angeles on march 1 1986 with only 1200 marchers mixner

executive committee of the clinton for president campaign the first openly gay person to become a public face of a presidential campaign after clinton was elected mixner helped with the transition team though he publicly declared that he would not seek an appointment with the new administration although he spoke at an event at the inaugural ball introduced by his old friend ted kennedy mixner soon thrust himself in the middle of the furor over the do nt ask do nt tell policy proposed by clinton which represented a total betrayal to mixner and many in the gay community when mixner went on nightline to complain about clinton s rapid shift away from allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military his calls to the white house stopped being returned and his consulting business began to tank as he was no longer perceived as someone who had influence with the new administration shortly thereafter mixner participated in a march in washington for the campaign for military service which advocated lifting the bans on gays in the military when clinton announced the do nt ask do nt tell policy on july 19 1993 mixner organized a march with cms and was very publicly arrested

with the bolivian hierarchy of the roman catholic church this has become a problem for morales as polls taken in the early 2000s indicate that 77 of the bolivian population say they are catholic meaning that about seven million of the nine million bolivians follow the roman catholic faith when faced with a morales policy that they disagree with catholic bishops of bolivia are able to inspire large demonstrations against the measures the catholic church draws most of its support from the cities and little from the higher rural areas where morales draws his main support due to a lack of resources and to indigenous cultural resistance to church efforts to replace traditional attitudes morales has stated that he is a catholic  he like many rural bolivians was raised with a combination of catholicism and belief in the pachamama or mother earth figure as well as on ekeko a traditional indigenous god of luck harvests and general abundance other indigenous leaders like felix patzi see below follow a pure indigenous faith and discard all forms of christianity however this effort has not led to a significant increase in the number of indigenousbelief only worshippers the special place given to catholicism in bolivia can be seen in article 3 of the bolivian constitution which says the state recognizes and sustains the catholic apostolic and roman religion it guarantees the public exercise of all other faiths relations with the catholic church shall be governed by concordats and agreements between the bolivian state and the holy see the united states state department has characterized this as the constitution recognizes it catholicism as the official religion a statement that the comments of bolivian bishops see below would seem to disagree with on june 18 2006 the archbishop of santa cruz de la sierra cardinal julio terrazas addressed the rumors that congressional candidates to the bolivian parliament were saying that the catholic church was demanding to be made the official religion of bolivia in his sunday sermon the cardinal assured people that they were not seeking or fighting to achieve such a goal he pointed out that the bishops had until recently been open to reviewing the bolivian constitution s article that granted special recognition to the role of catholicism the cardinal said they keep saying we are fighting for that article not so let it be reviewed but let it be done intelligently and fully let s not deny that this country has truly received the seeds of the kingdom of justice and of truth that the lord has brought and that that has been part of her history and that is why in so many parts of bolivia we are proud to be catholics the cardinal pointed out that catholicism had stopped being the official state religion of bolivia since 1967 and said the church is merely asking for respect and recognition of the work she has done he said those who are calling for secularism are hiding their other intentions to strip bolivia of religion and order a country in such a way that god is not present in early june 2006 the socialist party of evo morales movimiento al socialismo seized lands adjacent to a marian shrine in copacabana these lands where originally given to the shrine decades ago by the bolivian government so that income derived by use of the land would help support the shrine at the seizure party loyalists declared that they were taking only the unproductive lands of the church and the land was divided into seven lots and several trees were cut down father obermaier in charge of the shrine called for the government to resolve the situation on july 27 2006 while the education reform controversy was ongoing see below the socialist senator antonio peredo joined with other members of morales movimiento al socialismo in the bolivian parliament to call for an end of recognizing catholic feast days such as corpus christi and all saints day as national holidays the suggested policy was to only recognize holy week and christmas for the nationally recognized holidays to change the policy would have to be approved by the full parliament in early june 2006 bolivian education minister felix patzi working under president evo morales declared that education will emphatically be secular and no longer catholic religion classes will now be optional instead of obligatory there will be a course on the history of religions indigenous arabic or catholic the reform called for secular education that respects the beliefs the spirituality of indigenous and native nations and of the bolivian nations as the basis of individual and communitarian rights the bolivian roman catholic hierarchy immediately opposed this proposal and saw it as an attack on religion in bolivia they were outspoken against the measure and organized protests against it in june 2006 minister felix patzi a sociologist of aymara indian descent who practices a precolumbian religion that worships the earth goddess brought organizational opposition against the morales governments ideas when he declared that catholicism would no longer be the official religion taught at schools o patzi s said that he wanted to end the the religious monopoly of the catholic faith in schools and allow all faith to be taught from oriental religions to those practiced by our native peoples he said he would end the policy that makes catholic religious classes obligatory for students and called the existing system colonial in an interview with the newspaper la razon patzi said in bolivia the people are not only catholic but also of other religious faiths he stated his fear of the issue leading to confrontation among bolivians after protests by the catholic hierarchy patzi clarified that the sectarian roman catholic classes taught in state schools would be replaced with a history of religions class that would include a focus on traditional indigenous beliefs alongside catholicism and other faiths practiced in bolivia patzi said that catholicism would no longer be the official religion of the country s educational system the morales government s announced its policy as a call for secular education that respects the beliefs the spirituality of indigenous and native nations and of the bolivian nations as the basis of individual and communitarian rights it was announced that the proposal would come before the national assembly for a vote on august 6 2006 immediately after patzi s statements archbishop tito solari of cochabamba said the morales government must be consistent when it talks about respecting beliefs which implies respecting the catholic beliefs of the majority of bolivians he defended the existence of covenant schools which are administered by the hierarchy of the catholic church but are paid for by bolivian taxes drawn from both catholics and noncatholics alike solari said parents are the first and foremost educators of their children therefore they have the right to choose the kind of education they want â€¦ families are very appreciative of the schools that are administered by the church which serve the community and in a special way those in need he defined what he thought was the proper role of the government saying the state and the institutions of civil society can contribute in a democratic atmosphere to people choosing the best educational model for the integral and critical formation of persons in midjune 2006 a spokeswoman for the bolivian bishops committee on education demanded that the morales government clarify its position on religious instruction in state schools she said we are anxious not out of fear but out of concern that the government define its position in order to begin dialogue she took issue with patzi labeling the current system as colonialist saying he is ignoring the church s contribution to culture education health care and development in bolivia she pointed out that the church respects other beliefs and is not asking for catholicism to be forced upon the people she accused the socialist morales government of having an antifaith bias i think the problem is not with the church but with the faith of the people who are 80 catholic responding to patzi s comments the archbishop of santa cruz cardinal julio terrazas sandoval called for bolivian catholics to defend their faith he also called on president morales to note the difference between a lay state and a secular state that is hostile to religions â€¦ the catholic church will defend the universal right to profess a religion this is unrenounceable and nonnegotiable this is the basis for helping to form a family that is much more united in the cause of the kingdom of justice and peace and to build a country that is not in constant turmoil bishop jesus juarez of el alto accused the morales government of using doublespeak in its educational policies after the bishops statements morales stressed that religion courses would not be eliminated from public schools in july 1015 2006 in sucre bolivia during a meeting of the national educational congress delegates from the bishops conference of bolivia walked out claiming it had become political and exclusive â€¦ the government is seeking to impose its new education law which reflects an attitude that prevents dialogue about certain aspects of the future of education in bolivia education minister felix patzi spoke with several bishops in a latenight meeting and pledged to uphold religious instruction in schools and respect the churchstate agreement saying we recognize the contribution of the church in the area of education technical formation and other areas religious subject matter will respect the diversity of religions and that is something we share with the church everyone has the right to practice the diversity of other religions there was never any disagreement on that bishop jesus juarez of el alto who together with auxiliary bishop luis sainz of cochabomba said that not only do parochial schools have a fundamental right to offer instruction according to their own confession but that in state schools the parents should be able to choose which type of religious instruction their children will receive bishop sainz demanded the morales government clarify and come up with a consensus about the concept of secular education so that there are no longer any doubts at the end of its conference the national educational congress led by patzi approved a resolution saying education in bolivia is secular and pluralistic because it respects the spirituality of each culture and freedom of belief it promotes its own values and rejects every type of dogmatisms they called for the curricula to be adapted in accord with the diverse beliefs of the country while before patzi had stated that the policy would only go into effect after its consideration by the bolivian parliament after the educational congress approved the measure he declared that its conclusions were binding and would be implemented immediately o this drew another wave of protests from bolivian catholics who demanded patzi s resignation archbishop tito solari described the morales government s actions at the event as operating in a communist fashion the government imposed its ideology without any room for dialogue after the bishops delegates had left those remaining approved the policy to expand the scope of the religious classes auxiliary bishop estanislao dowlaszewicz of santa cruz characterized the results by saying today some people live as if they were allergic to religion or the church â€¦ depicting it as a danger for the future of the country â€¦ they are trying to remove not only religion from the classroom but god as well archbishop edmundo abastoflor of la paz made comments believed to be in response to the education question saying at a commemoration of bolivian independence in front of the attending bolivian president evo morales the archbishop declared it is crazy to think that god does nt exist or that we can forget about him â€¦ no matter how important we might be in this world there is someone who is more so than us in late july 2006 protestant theologian matias preisweik of the ecumenical higher institute endorsed the new policy at a forum called the state religion and the new political constitution o he said in this moment of reappreciation of things andean is there not the dream of having a country ruled by the values of its own ancestral and holistic religiosity he criticized the catholic church saying it is recognized as the tutelary institution like the armed forces but in religious matters â€¦ and it portrays itself as a superior force that intercedes for bolivians before the kingdom of god he called for a greater separation of church and state and cited the difficulties of those calling for legalizing abortion on demand as an example of catholicism imposing its views  the catholic church s position on abortion in bolivia had recently gained international attention in 2000 when bishop jesus juarez considered excommunicating judge juan luis ledezma for ignoring church directives and ordering doctors to go ahead and allow a 12 yearold girl raped by her stepfather to have an abortion  responding to preisweik s comments archbishop edmundo abastoflor of la paz said that the church does not exercise or hold any political power and that her members live the vocation of service through educational and social works in benefit of those in need on july 23 2006 bolivia s cardinal julio terrazas told catholics they needed to stop being passive and defend the faith he warned them that great wars began with small theories with this discourse of hate rancor of unforgiveness patzi then came out against the catholic hierarchy stating they are saying we are going to destroy the church and its beliefs how untrue excellencies do not lie to the people give them the whole truth the hard truth the truth does not destroy hypocrisy sooner or later will become visible by july 25 2006 catholic organizations had led street marches in cities including santa cruz and tarija after these protests patzi went further in his claims saying the church is now showing her true face the church is now on the side of the oligarchy because for 514 years the church has been at the service of the oligarchy and the rich nobody can deny it o morales then came out in support of patzi accusing the bishops of acting as if this were the inquisition he claimed that the bishops were still seeking a certain vestige of power morales explained his comments to reporters saying i want to ask the church hierarchies that they understand freedom of religion and beliefs in our country it s not possible to impose their views â€¦ i am worried by the behavior of some catholic church leaders who are acting like in times of the inquisition in late july 2006 former bolivian president jorge quiroga who lost the 2005 election to evo morales  criticized the remarks of president morales which compared the actions of the roman catholic hierarchy in bolivia with the inquisition quiroga said that such rhetoric should be avoided because it only brings negative consequences he declared he would champion the opposition against the government policies on religious classes saying religion is an issue that should not be politicized what we have clearly said as the opposition is that the teaching of religion be respected and we are going to defend it o the calls by the catholic hierarchy to resist morales policy against sectarian religious classes in state schools caused a dip in his popularity in midjuly 2006 the newspaper la razon did a survey of 1009 bolivians living in the country s four major cities the survey showed morales with an approval rating of 68 percent down from 75 percent in june it also found that 83 percent of bolivians surveyed have a favorable opinion of the catholic church on july 30 2006 after a 21 hour conference with cardinal julio terrazas morales in the city of cochabamba ended the dispute by reversing his stance and backing away from the proposal the associated press reported that in a joint statement that mentioned religious diversity but made no provision for broadening the scope of the solely catholic curriculum taught in bolivia s schools both men said the government and the catholic church agree to preserve the course on religion respecting the existing religious diversity in the country in september 2006 the confederation of inner city education workers of bolivia in a proposal called rescuing the homeland called for a law that would eliminate all religious instruction in state schools including the 200 statefunded covenant schools which are administered by the catholic church the proposal said education should be secular if we want it to be scientific the catholic church warned that all of the advances made by the church could be lost if the state takes over the covenant schools and rallied to oppose any such proposals in august 2006 the roman catholic bishop of oruro cristobal bialasik led thousands of catholic students and parents through the city s streets demanding that the morales government leave sectarian catholic classes in the state schools they also insisted that the government quash any suggestions toward amending the bolivian constitution s official recognition of roman catholicism the bolivian constitution at article three says the state recognizes and sustains the catholic apostolic roman religion it guarantees the public exercise of all other faiths the relations with the catholic church shall be governed by concordats and agreements between the bolivian state and the holy see bishop bialasik stated that peace and unity will only come to bolivia if we respect our faith if we respect god â€¦ and learn to live the values that he teaches us auxiliary bishop luis saenz of cochabamba called on catholics to protest knowing that bolivia is a country of one people devoted to the one true god and his blessed mother mary under her different titles wants all bolivians to be united â€¦ let us pray that god will illumine the darkness in order to extinguish lies and deceit â€¦ because they want to silence us god s message is free god gives us the strength to guide our people the catholic church shall not be enslaved she is not a slave to the government because she is not a political party fear not bolivia because the church is born of god on january 18 2007 fr freddy del villar vicar general of the coroicu diocese in bolivia said that the catholic church remains vigilant concerning the socialist morales government he said they are still reserving judgement on the upcoming revision to the bolivian constitution he said the church is worried but at the same time optimistic about the new constitution the morales government is preparing obviously the party of evo morales is socialist for example it says it wants to have a nonconfessional education or that religion is not important but let us see what comes out of the new constitution when it will be finished in august he declared that with factions in bolivia seemingly attempting to disintegrate bolivia the church helps to maintain unity in the country  food safety incidents in the people s republic of china have received increased

sudan i illegally for years before 2005 and government officials gave two reasons why the 1996 ban had not been adequately enforced the first reason was that there were too many agencies overseeing

weather by p g wodehouse 18811975  set at blandings castle it was made by the bbc and wgbh boston first screened by the bbc on christmas eve 1995 and shown in the united states on pbs s masterpiece theatre on 18 february 1996 though abridged for a 90minute film heavy weather followed closely the novel of 1933 the fourth in the blandings series many of the familiar elements of the blandings books were present the wish of lord emsworth s nephew ronnie fish to marry a chorus girl sue brown the concern of emsworth s sisters the imperious lady constance keeble and ronnie s mother lady julia fish to ensure that the reminiscences of their other brother the hon galahad threepwood were not published galahad s protectiveness towards miss brown the daughter of his long lost love dolly henderson the sustained efforts of the publisher lord tilbury a character probably based on lord northcliffe to gain possession of the reminiscences lord emsworth s determination that his prize berkshire pig the empress of blandings should win the silver medal in the fat pigs class at the shrewsbury agricultural show lord emsworth s employment of a private detective p frobisher pilbeam to protect the empress and his rivalry with his neighbour sir gregory parsloe of matchingham hall who had not only his own designs on the fat pigs class but as a prospective parliamentary candidate an interest in suppressing galahad s reminiscences and the employment as lord emsworth s secretary of monty bodkin who as with most holders of that office had an ulterior motive in this instance the need to hold down paid employment for a year in order to be considered suitable to marry one gertrude butterwick  heavy weather had a distinguished cast peter otoole as clarence lord emsworth richard briers as galahad threepwood judy parfitt as lady constance sarah badel as lady julia roy hudd as beach the butler ronald fraser as sir gregory parsloe and richard johnson as lord tilbury the recently ennobled george ineper stinker ineper pyke pilbeam was played by david bamber who became widely known around the same time as mr collins in the bbc s adaptation of jane austen s pride and prejudice other members of the cast included rebecca lacey as sue brown benjamin soames as ronnie fish and samuel west as monty bodkin the screenplay was written by douglas livingstone born 1930  the director was jack gold and the producers verity lambert and david shanks there were many devotees of wodehouse who assumed at the time that heavy weather was in effect a pilot for a series of blandings adaptations as such this would have complemented the four series of jeeves and wooster granada 19903  stories derived from wodehouse that featured rising stars stephen fry as jeeves and hugh laurie as bertie wooster however not only did no series follow but heavy weather has never been repeated on british television it was however released on video vhs by acorn media in 1999 a dvd release is yet to appear this alone tended to set it apart from the array of successful dramas set in the second and early third quarters of the 20th century that had were shown on british television in the 1980s and early 90s in addition to jeeves and wooster these included definitive adaptations from 1984 onwards of agatha christie s miss marple and poirot stories with joan hickson and david suchet in the leading roles  other detective stories such as christie s the seven dials mystery lwt 1980  featuring cheryl campbell as a neowodehousian flapper lady bundle brent and margery allingham s about albert campion bbc 198990  the house of elliot bbc 19914  with louise lombard and stella gonet as struggling couturiers in the 1920s and two series lwt 19856  based on e f benson s mapp and lucia novels that although described by one leading critic as nicely realised if appealing more to the fans of the six novels than to the audience in general were nevertheless repeated several times over the following twenty years and released in both vhs and dvd formats in fact as film historian leslie halliwell noted wodehouse s sagas of upper class twits and manservants in the twenties have been oddly neglected by the screen though they were much imitated o however there were two films made in the 1930s with arthur treacher as jeeves thank you jeeves in 1936 which also featured david niven as wooster and step lively jeeves in 1937 and in 1937 a damsel in distress 1919  virtually a blandings novel but with different characters was turned by rko into a musical film scored by george gershwin that starred fred astaire and joan fontaine an adaptation by c e webber of a wodehouse short story of 1935 was broadcast on bbc children s television in march 1956 as lord emsworth and the little friend then in the 1960s the bbc made a popular series called the world of wooster 19657  featuring dennis price as jeeves and ian carmichael as a rather middleaged bertie wooster wodehouse himself much preferred price s performance  this led to among other spinoffs a series of blandings castle 1967 with sir ralph richardson as lord emsworth meriel forbes as lady constance stanley holloway as beach derek nimmo as galahad threepwood and as one wodehouse scholar acutely observed a wessex saddleback rather than a berkshire as the empress of blandings between 198492 there were several bbc radio adaptations of blandings in which richard vernon as lord emsworth conveyed a mix of eccentricity and amiability his delivery being quite similar to that in his occasional role in yes minister and yes prime minister bbc tv 19808 as the befuddled city banker sir desmond glazebrook  ian carmichael played galahad in a number of these productions in 1992 random house audiobooks released an abridged version of heavy weather read by martin jarvis in 1995 heavy weather became the only visual featurelength version of blandings since the second world war closer to the original novel than most other adaptations of wodehouse some may have found peter otoole s emsworth a little too eccentric and irascible while the touches of realism such as quantities of pigswill which tended not to intrude into earlier wodehouse productions conceivably detracted from the cosy air of fantasy but even so the lack of any followup to such a major enterprise seemed puzzling to many like the adaptations of benson s mapp and lucia heavy weather probably appealed more to fans of wodehouse than to a wider audience a serious consideration for a programme broadcast at peak viewing time on christmas eve  it is possible too that by the mid 1990s the public s appetite for dramas of the 1920s and 30s was beginning to wane a genre that was coming strongly back into vogue at the time was the large scale adaptation of the classic novel this was typified by the bbc s pride and prejudice with colin firth as darcy and jennifer ehle as elizabeth bennet ehle having come to public attention as the vampish calypso in the camomile lawn channel 4 s dramatisation 1992 of mary wesley s novel 1984  which opened on the eve of war in 1939  but there were also feature films of other jane austen novels such as sense and sensibility with emma thompson kate winslet and hugh grant 1995 and emma a film with gwyneth paltrow in the title role and a tv version with kate beckinsale both 1996  a further landmark was the film four weddings and a funeral 1994  starring hugh grant this was a highly successful light comedy in the tradition of the ealing films of the late 1940s and early 50s but clearly rooted in the present day and with some of its vernacular language  rather than looking to the past the mid 1990s were a period of transition in british popular culture and arguably in the country more generally although in 1993 the prime minister john major had made a widely quoted almost betjemaneque assertion that fifty years on from now britain will still be the country of long shadows on county cricket grounds warm beer and as george orwell said old maids bicycling to holy communion this seemed to some a rather sentimental and complacent view by 1995 britpop was at its height in certain respects mirroring the impact of the beatles thirty years earlier and about to be caught up or subsumed in the concept of cool britannia 19967 would see the rise of socalled girl power notably for a time in the pervasive guise of the spice girls  the sweeping election victory in may 1997 of tony blair and his new ineorg labour party and a few months later the death of diana princess of wales the mawkish public reaction to which was thought by many at the time to have changed britain for ever although as evelyn waugh once said mr wodehouse s idyllic word can never stale he has made a world for us to live in and delight in the circumstances of britain towards at the end of the 20th century probably did not bode well for a sustained revival of blandings for example in the next few years the continuing adaptations of poirot became a little darker in tone and dispensed with many of the lighter elements of the earlier episodes such as poirot s associate captain hastings who had many wodehousian characteristics and like conan doyle s dr watson was unable to keep his cognition uncontaminated by his alltoohuman emotions and motives  in 2001 the film gosford park a murder mystery set in 1932 which harked back to the deep focus of jean renoir s 1939 film la rã¨gle du jeu firmly established a trend away from the nostalgic lavish period recreations of which heavy weather was one of the last that had been prevalent since the late 1970s even so a sign of wodehouse s sustained influence was the establishment as the internet began to take hold in the mid 1990s of a search engine called ask jeeves this title survived until shortened to ask in 2006 the following year when it was reported that the british prime minister wished to employ a butler in fact a house manager  the mail on sunday referred to mr blair s very own 21st century jeeves o heavy weather was filmed at sudeley castle gloucestershire which was widely though not universally regarded as wodehouse s model for blandings wodehouse set blandings in the more northerly county of shropshire a location that stimulated some intriguing research by richard usborne a leading wodehouse scholar into train journeys of which there were two in heavy weather between london s paddington station and market blandings sudeley was the home during her marriage to thomas seymour of queen katherine parr sixth wife of king henry viii katherine died in 1548 and is buried in the chapel at sudeley the castle has been owned since 1837 by the dent brocklehurst family in 1972 it passed on the death of his father to henry dent brocklehurst born 1966  whose mother later lady ashcombe initially held sudeley in trust and by the mid 1990s had done much to develop its potential for tourism and business the location of heavy weather at sudeley assisted public awareness of the castle and its grounds sudeley s promotional literature emphasised the wodehouse connection noting for example that the double yew hedges in the queen s garden were the inspiration for the gardens of blandings  henry augustus peirce 18081885 was an american businessman and diplomat some sources spell his last name as pierce he was born in

1874 again with no successor and the crisis deepened when king kaläkaua was elected by the legislature supporters of queen emma of hawaii who was popular with the people started to protest at the request of c r bishop who was minister of the interior peirce called out american troops from the frigates and on november 17 1874 kaläkaua left accompanied by peirce and some other government ministers on a visit to washington dc which was the first state visit of a ruling monarch to the united states they were guests at a state dinner and reception with president ulysses s grant and the us cabinet the reciprocity treaty of 1875 allowed use of pearl harbor by the us in exchange for elimination of tariffs on hawaiian goods this was a careful compromise between those who wanted full annexation of the islands or cessation of the harbor and others who opposed any threats to sovereignty peirce had worked for years on arranging the trip and treaty interrupted by the deaths of the two previous monarchs kaläkaua offered peirce the royal order of kamehameha but he had to wait until no longer employed by the us government to accept he served until being replaced by james m comly on september 25 1877 on november 17 1877 he arrived in san francisco but the cold weather convinced him to return to hawaii january 8 1878 as he was about to leave kaläkaua offered him the post of minister of foreign affairs for the kingdom of hawaii on march 1 there was a shortage of experienced politicians and diplomats willing to serve in fact the minister from the kingdom to the united states was fellow new englander elisha hunt allen americans were negotiating on both sides of the 1875 treaty allen also was chief justice of the hawaii supreme court however after a no confidence vote was narrowly defeated by the legislature kaläkaua replaced his entire cabinet on july 3 1878 peirce served for one session in the house of nobles and was sent to an exhibition in boston in 1883 he returned to boston one more time and then resided in san francisco where he died on july 29 1885  the holtzman effect is a fictional scientific phenomenon in the dune universe created by frank herbert beginning with the 1965 novel dune the effect is never explained in detail but it makes among other things defensive force shields and instantaneous space travel possible frank herbert was inconsistent with the spelling of holtzman resulting in the variant spellings holtzmann 1976 s children of dune and holzmann 1985 s chapterhouse dune  this is likely intentional as herbert mutated other words and names over the several millennia the dune series spans such as the change of arrakis to rakis and caladan to dan beginning with heretics of dune 1984  according to the legends of dune prequel trilogy by brian herbert and kevin j anderson 20022004  the holtzman effect is named after the scientist who discovered it tio holtzman though for many of its applications holtzman in fact takes credit for the mathematical theories of his assistant norma cenva  in terminology of the imperium the glossary of the novel dune frank herbert provides the following definition in dune the technology has been adapted for reliable use in personal defensive shields these shields unlike many others in science fiction are not round projections of force but formfitting energy fields which permit penetration only by objects that move below a preset velocity paul atreides notes in dune in shield fighting one moves fast on defense slow on attack attack has the sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep setting him up for the attack sinister the shield turns the fast blow admits the slow kindjal as one would be unable to breathe within a shield that did not permit atmospheric gases to penetrate it manportable shields have a relatively high penetration velocity approximately six to nine centimeters per second the interaction of a lasgun beam and a holtzman field results in subatomic fusion and a nuclear explosion the magnitude of this blast is unpredictable sometimes it destroys only the shielded target and gunner sometimes the explosion is more powerful than atomics using lasguns in a shielded environment can result in military and environmental catastrophe though at one point in dune duncan idaho deliberately allows shieldlasgun contact as a discouragement to his enemies in god emperor of dune 1981  the god emperor leto ii notes 3500 years into his reign that shields are banned throughout the empire and it is a capital offense to possess one to avoid such explosive interactions the vibrations of an active shield will drive a sandworm on arrakis into a killing frenzy drawing them from across territorial lines to attack the shield for this reason the native fremen eschew them it is noted in children of dune that the fremen have developed a small shield generator known as a pseudoshield to attract and madden a worm for use as an ersatz bomb the effect is used in this case to fold space at the quantum level allowing the spacing guild s heighliner ships to instantaneously travel far distances across space however the chaotic and seemingly nondeterministic quantum nature of foldspace requires at least limited prescience on the part of the human navigator otherwise the absurdly complex mathematics involved in producing reliable physical projections of such events would only be possible with advanced thinking machines which are strictly prohibited because of mankind s crusade against thinking machines the butlerian jihad to this effect the guild produces melangesaturated navigators who intuitively see paths through foldspace in this way this stumbling block is overcome several thousand years after the events of dune when ixian scientists develop mechanical replacements for guild navigators hovering devices called suspensors utilize the secondary lowdrain phase of a holtzman field generator to nullify gravity within certain limits prescribed by relative mass and energy consumption suspensors are used in chairs tables and structures that are too massive to be physically sound among many other obvious uses in dune the grotesquely obese baron vladimir harkonnen utilizes suspensor belts and harnesses to buoy his flesh and allow him to walk in dune jessica theorizes that suspensors like shields attract sandworms and while some are seen in fremen sietch communities none are active in the deep desert a varied use of the holtzman effect is the glowglobe this device is a small glowing sphere that floats gracefully above a surface like a portable personal sun since it is typically tuned to a yellowish color herbert s description in the glossary of dune reads the noncanon dune encyclopedia 1984 by dr willis e mcnelly invents an extensive alternate origin and description of the holtzman effect in this version it is discovered by ibrahim vaughn holtzman born 7593 bg  the son of the planetary governor of liesco ii holtzman has a specialized ship constructed and escapes into space to think o his mathematical genius is enhanced by the exponentiallyincreased mental processing made possible by his new computerized form which also allows him to exist for nearly 7500 years  he focuses on analyzing the suspensornullification effect which as frank herbert established makes interstellar travel possible according to the encyclopedia this effect had been discovered 5400 years earlier but is not fully understood holtzman s first related discovery is an instantaneous interstellar communication device later called the holtzman wave until this point interstellar travel had effected a widespread population of the universe which could no longer be controlled by the imperial house ceres the development of holtzman wave generators gives mankind the means to easily communicate across vast distances and results in the long and ferocious wars of reunification holtzman himself remains in seclusion returning to civilization five times on his third return over 2000 years after his original escape he gives humanity his next related discovery defensive shields on his fourth return millennia later holtzman published his unified theory linking the various effects into a single hierarchy of phenomena o the last intelligent machine left in existence after the butlerian jihad he is apparently destroyed in 108 bg knowing his ship is booby trapped with a dormant laser aimed at a defensive shield the jihad fleet send a volunteer to board the ship thereby setting off the explosion which results from shieldlaser interaction according to the encyclopedia the threedimensional suspensornullification effect is discovered thousands of years before holtzman explored the associated phenomena his name is eventually applied to all manifestations of the holtzman effect the brian herbert kevin j anderson legends of dune prequel trilogy 20022004 establishes that the holtzman effect is discovered by and named after scientist and inventor tio holtzman immediately prior to the butlerian jihad some 10000 years before the events of dune the technology is employed for defensive force fields capable of scrambling the gelcircuitry of thinking machines the force of sentient computers and robots who seek to enslave and exterminate mankind networks of towers generating the field from the surface protect entire planets from machine attacks residing on the planet poritrin holtzman s career is on the wane as he has not invented anything significant in several years he comes across the work of norma cenva a woman from rossak realizing her genius he invites her to come work with him on poritrin the machines soon realize that their cymeks humanmachine hybrids can slip though the planetary force fields to destroy the transmitters because they possess human brains which are unaffected by the scrambler fields cenva has the idea to use the field as an offensive weapon projecting it with portable transmitters to knock out machines and their installations holtzman later calculates that the field can be modified to prevent penetration from physical projectiles cenva agrees correcting the flaws in his concept but noting that objects can still pass through the shield at a slow enough speed the human forces start installing these new shields on their battleships and most ground forces however as it is still a new technology at the time the shields tend to overheat with too much use and deactivate as time passes holtzman discovers that the young dwarfish woman is much more creative than he and after being upstaged by her twice begins to dislike her eventually he takes credit for cenva s mathematical theories which lead to many practical uses for holtzman s original discovery including the holtzman drive holtzman shields suspensors and glowglobes cenva is also credited with the realization that hitting a holtzman field with a lasgun beam results in a large and unpredictable explosion her theory is proven in the 2003 novel dune the machine crusade when holtzman himself is killed by the explosion from such an interaction during a slave uprising on poritrin the legends of dune series also establishes that cenva invents the theory of space folding in 177 bg during the butlerian jihad after years of working on holtzman s original field equations by 174 bg she had built a prototype spacefolding ship and soon she and industrialist aurelius venport establish a shipyard on the planet kolhar to produce what would eventually be called heighliners within a decade venport puts the spacefolding technology and shipyards at the disposal of the jihad forces initially foldspace travel is not completely accurate or safe only about nine out of every ten heighliners make it to their final destination realizing that the spice melange amplifies her psychic and calculative abilities norma pioneers the use of massive concentrated doses to presciently perceive space time in 88 bg she discovers that this is the way to safely navigate foldspace and essentially becomes the first navigator that same year norma s son adrien venport founds the foldspace shipping company which later becomes the spacing guild and eventually monopolizes space commerce transport and interplanetary banking cenva s name is eventually forgotten by history but she is more interested in improving defensive shields and developing foldspace travel to make it safer and more efficient her efforts help humanity defeat the thinking machines in 1999 s dune house atreides the first novel of the prelude to dune prequel trilogy by brian herbert and anderson  the following is stated via epigraph  hunter stockton thompson july 18 1937 february 20 2005 was an american journalist and author most famous for his roman a clef fear and loathing in las vegas he is credited as the creator of gonzo journalism a style of reporting where reporters involve themselves in the

young age thompson joined louisville s castlewood athletic club a sports club for teenagers that prepared them for highschool sports where he excelled in baseball though he never joined any sports teams in high school where he was constantly in trouble thompson attended the in bloom elementary school and then highland middle school then atherton high school transferring to louisville male high school in 1952 following the death of his father that same year he was accepted as a member of the athenaeum literary association a schoolsponsored literary and social club that had been founded at male high in 1862 its members at the time generally drawn from louisville s wealthy upperclass families included porter bibb who became the first publisher of rolling stone as an athenaeum member thompson contributed articles and helped edit the club s yearbook the spectator however the group ejected thompson from its membership in 1955 citing his legal problems charged as an accessory to robbery after having been in a car with the person who committed the robbery thompson was sentenced to serve 60 days in kentucky s jefferson county jail he served 30 days of his sentence and joined the us air force a week after his release thompson did his basic training at lackland air force base in san antonio texas and later transferred to scott air force base in illinois to study electronics he applied to become a pilot but was rejected by the air force s aviationcadet program in 1956 he transferred to eglin air force base near pensacola florida there he worked in the informationservices department and became the sports editor of the base s newspaper the command courier in this capacity he covered the eglin eagles a base football team that included such future professional stars as max mcgee and zeke bratkowski thompson traveled with the team around the us covering its games in 1957 he also wrote a sports column anonymously for the playground news a local newspaper in fort walton beach florida thompson left the air force in 1958 as an airman first class having been recommended for an early honorable discharge by his commanding officer in summary this airman although talented will not be guided by policy col william s evans chief of information services wrote to the eglin personnel office sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems to rub off on other airmen staff members o thompson claimed in a mock press release he wrote about the end of his duty to have been issued a totally unclassifiable status after the air force he worked as sports editor for a newspaper in jersey shore pennsylvania before moving to new york city there he attended columbia university s school of general studies parttime on the gi bill taking classes in shortstory writing thompson s friends and letters from this period note he was an avid reader of the beat generation during his early years as a writer and that he associated himself with the beat culture while living in new york city he would later befriend such beat authors as allen ginsberg and william s burroughs during this time he worked briefly for time as a copy boy for 51 a week while working he used a typewriter to copy f scott fitzgerald s the great gatsby and ernest hemingway s a farewell to arms in order to learn about the writing styles of the authors in 1959 time fired him for insubordination later that year he worked as a reporter for the middletown daily record in middletown new york he was fired from this job after damaging an office candy machine and arguing with the owner of a local restaurant who happened to be an advertiser with the paper in 1960 thompson moved to san juan puerto rico to take a job with the sporting magazine el sportivo which soon folded after his arrival thompson had first applied for a job with the puerto rico englishlanguage daily the san juan star but its managing editor future novelist william j kennedy declined thompson s request nonetheless the two became friends and after the demise of el sportivo thompson worked as a stringer for the new york herald tribune and a few stateside papers on caribbean issues with kennedy working as his editor after returning to the states hunter lived in california working as a security guard and caretaker at the big sur hot springs for an eightmonth period in 1961 just before it became the esalen institute while there he was able to publish his first magazine feature in the nationally distributed rogue magazine on the artisan and bohemian culture of big sur the unwanted publicity generated from the article got him fired from his job as a caretaker during this period thompson wrote two novels prince jellyfish and the rum diary and submitted many short stories to publishers with little success the rum diary which fictionalized thompson s experiences in puerto rico was eventually published in 1998 long after thompson had become famous from may 1962 to may 1963 thompson traveled to south america as a correspondent for a dow jonesowned weekly newspaper the national observer in brazil he spent several months working also as a reporter on the brazil herald the country s only englishlanguage daily published in rio de janeiro his longtime girlfriend sandra dawn conklin aka sandy conklin thompson now sondi wright later joined him in rio thompson and conklin were married on may 19 1963 shortly after they returned to the united states they briefly relocated to aspen colorado and had one son juan fitzgerald thompson born march 23 1964 the couple conceived five more times together three of the pregnancies were miscarried and the other two pregnancies produced infants who died shortly after birth hunter and sandy divorced in 1980 but remained close friends until thompson s death in 1964 the thompson family then moved to glen ellen california where thompson continued to write for the national observer on an array of domestic subjects including a story about his 1964 visit to ketchum idaho in order to investigate the reasons for ernest hemingway s suicide while working on the story thompson symbolically stole a pair of elk antlers hanging above the front door of hemingway s cabin thompson and the editors at the observer eventually had a falling out after the paper refused to print thompson s review of tom wolfe s 1965 essay collection the kandykolored tangerineflake streamline baby and he moved to san francisco immersing himself in the drug and hippie culture that was taking root in the area about this time he began writing for the berkeley underground paper the spyder in 1965 carey mcwilliams editor of the nation offered thompson the opportunity to write a story based on his experience with the californiabased hells angels motorcycle gang after the nation published the article may 17 1965  thompson received several book offers and spent the next year living and riding with the hell s angels the relationship broke down when the bikers suspected that thompson was only friends with them so he could make money from his writing the gang demanded a share of the profits and after an argument at a party thompson ended up with a savage beating or stomping as the angels referred to it random house published the hard cover hell s angels the strange and terrible saga of the outlaw motorcycle gangs in 1966 a reviewer for the new york times praised it as an angry knowledgeable fascinating and excitedly written book that shows the hells angels not so much as dropouts from society but as total misfits or unfits emotionally intellectually and educationally unfit to achieve the rewards such as they are that the contemporary social order offers o the reviewer also praised thompson as a spirited witty observant and original writer his prose crackles like motorcycle exhaust following the success of hells angels thompson was able to publish articles in a number of wellknown magazines during the late 1960s including the new york times magazine esquire pageant and others in the times magazine article published in 1967 shortly before the summer of love and entitled the hashbury is the capital of the hippies thompson wrote indepth about the hippies of san francisco deriding a culture that began to lack the political convictions of the new left and the artistic core of the beats instead becoming overrun with newcomers lacking any purpose other than obtaining drugs it was an observation on the 60s counterculture that thompson would further examine in fear and loathing in las vegas and other articles according to thompson s letters and his later writings at this time he planned to write a book called the joint chiefs about the death of the american dream o he used a 6000 advance from random house to travel on the 1968 presidential campaign trail and attend the 1968 democratic convention in chicago for research purposes from his hotel room in chicago thompson watched the clashes between police and protesters which he wrote had a great effect on his political views the planned book was never finished but the theme of the death of the american dream would be carried over into his later work and the contract with random house was eventually fulfilled with the 1972 book fear and loathing in las vegas thompson also signed a deal with ballantine books in 1968 to write a satirical book called the johnson about lyndon b johnson a few weeks after the contract was signed however johnson announced that he would not stand for reelection and the deal was canceled by late 1967 thompson and his family moved back to colorado and rented a house in woody creek a small mountain hamlet outside aspen in early 1969 thompson finally received a 15000 royalty check for the paperback sales of hells angels and used twothirds of the money for a down payment on a modest home and property where he would live for the rest of his life he named the house owl farm and often described it as his fortified compound in 1970 thompson ran for sheriff of pitkin county colorado as part of a group of citizens running for local offices on the freak power ticket the platform included promoting the decriminalization of drugs for personal use only not trafficking as he disapproved of profiteering  tearing up the streets and turning them into grassy pedestrian malls banning any building so tall as to obscure the view of the mountains and renaming aspen fat city to deter investors thompson having shaved his head referred to his opponent as my longhaired opponent as the republican candidate had a crew cut with polls showing him with a slight lead in a threeway race thompson appeared at rolling stone magazine headquarters in san francisco with a sixpack of beer in hand and declared to editor jann wenner that he was about to be elected the next sheriff of aspen colorado and wished to write about the freak power movement thus thompson s first article in rolling stone was published as the battle of aspen with the byline by dr hunter s thompson candidate for sheriff  o despite the publicity thompson ended up narrowly losing the election while actually carrying the city of aspen he garnered only 44 of the countywide vote in what became a twoway race as the republican candidate for sheriff agreed to withdraw from the contest a few days before the election in order to consolidate the antithompson votes in return for the democrats withdrawing their candidate for county commissioner thompson later remarked that the rolling stone article mobilized his opposition far more than his supporters also in 1970 thompson wrote an article entitled the kentucky derby is decadent and depraved for the shortlived new journalism magazine scanlan s monthly although it was not widely read at the time the article is the first of thompson s to use techniques of gonzo journalism a style he would later employ in almost every literary endeavor the manic firstperson subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook ralph steadman who would later collaborate with thompson on several projects contributed expressionist penandink illustrations the first use of the word gonzo to describe thompson s work is credited to the journalist bill cardoso cardoso had first met thompson on a bus full of journalists covering the 1968 new hampshire primary in 1970 cardoso who by this time had become the editor of the boston globe sunday magazine wrote to thompson praising the kentucky derby piece in scanlan s monthly as a breakthrough this is it this is pure gonzo if this is a start keep rolling o thompson took to the word right away and according to illustrator ralph steadman said okay that s what i do gonzo thompson s first published use of the word gonzo appears in a passage in fear and loathing in las vegas a savage journey to the heart of the american dream free enterprise the american dream horatio alger gone mad on drugs in las vegas do it now pure gonzo journalism the book for which thompson gained most of his fame had its genesis during the research for strange rumblings in aztlan an exposã© for rolling stone on the 1970 killing of the mexicanamerican television journalist rubã©n salazar salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear gas canister fired by officers of the los angeles county sheriff s department during the national chicano moratorium march against the vietnam war one of thompson s sources for the story was oscar zeta acosta a prominent mexicanamerican activist and attorney finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of los angeles thompson and acosta decided to travel to las vegas nevada and take advantage of an assignment by sports illustrated to write a 250word photograph caption on the mint 400 motorcycle race held there what was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely thompson first submitted to sports illustrated a manuscript of 2500 words which was as he later wrote aggressively rejected o rolling stone publisher jann wenner was said to have liked the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication which gave me the push i needed to keep working on it thompson later wrote the result of the trip to las vegas became the 1972 book fear and loathing in las vegas which first appeared in the november 1971 issues of rolling stone as a twopart series it is written as a firstperson account by a journalist named raoul duke on a trip to las vegas with dr gonzo his 300pound samoan attorney to cover a narcotics officers convention and the fabulous mint 400 during the trip duke and his companion always referred to as my attorney become sidetracked by a search for the american dream with two bags of grass seventyfive pellets of mescaline five sheets of highpowered blotter acid a salt shaker half full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers downers screamers laughers and also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of budweiser a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement is a major theme of the novel and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim including being heralded by the new york times as by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope the vegas book as thompson referred to it was a mainstream success and introduced his gonzo journalism techniques to the masses within the next year thompson wrote extensively for rolling stone while covering the election campaigns of president richard nixon and his unsuccessful opponent senator george mcgovern the articles were soon combined and published as fear and loathing on the campaign trail 72 as the title suggests thompson spent nearly all of his time traveling the campaign trail focusing largely on the democratic party s primaries nixon as an incumbent performed little campaign work in which mcgovern competed with rival candidates edmund muskie and hubert humphrey thompson was an early supporter of mcgovern and it could be argued that his unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in the increasingly widely read rolling stone played a role in the senator s nomination thompson went on to become a fierce critic of nixon both during and after his presidency after nixon s death in 1994 thompson famously described him in rolling stone as a man who could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time and said his casket should have been launched into one of those opensewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of los angeles he was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president he was an evil manevil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the devil can understand it o the one passion they shared was a love of football which is discussed in fear and loathing on the campaign trail 72 thompson was to provide rolling stone similar coverage for the 1976 presidential campaign that would appear in a book published by the magazine reportedly as thompson was waiting for a 75000 advance cheque to arrive he learned that rolling stone publisher jann wenner had pulled the plug on the endeavor without telling thompson wenner then asked thompson to travel to vietnam to report on what appeared to be the closing of the vietnam war thompson accepted and left for saigon immediately he arrived with the country in chaos just as the united states was preparing to evacuate and other journalists were scrambling to find transportation out of the region while there thompson learned that wenner had pulled the plug on this excursion as well and thompson found himself in vietnam without health insurance or additional financial support thompson s story about the fall of saigon would not be published in rolling stone until ten years later these two incidents severely strained the relationship between the author and the magazine and thompson contributed far less to the publication in later years the year 1980 marked both his divorce from sandra conklin and the release of where the buffalo roam a loose film adaptation of situations from thompson s early 1970s work with bill murray starring as the author murray would go on to become one of thompson s only trusted friends after the lukewarm reception of the film thompson temporarily relocated to hawaii to work on a book the curse of lono a gonzostyle account of a marathon held in that state extensively illustrated by ralph steadman the piece first appeared in running magazine in 1981 as the charge of the weird brigade and was excerpted in playboy in 1983 on july 21 1981 in aspen colorado thompson was pulled over for running a stop sign at 2 am and began to rave at a state trooper he also refused to submit to intoxication tests consequently he was arrested but the drunkdriving charges against him were later dropped in 1983 he covered the us invasion of grenada but would not discuss these experiences until the publication of kingdom of fear 20 years later later that year he authored a piece for rolling stone called a dog took my place an exposã© of the scandalous roxanne pulitzer divorce and what he termed the palm beach lifestyle o the article contained dubious insinuations of bestiality among other things but was considered to be a return to proper form by many shortly thereafter thompson accepted an advance to write about couples pornography for playboy as part of his research in the spring of 1985 he spent evenings at the mitchell brothers ofarrell theater striptease club in san francisco and his experience there eventually evolved into a fulllength nonfiction novel tentatively titled the night manager neither the novel nor the article has been published at the behest of old friend and editor warren hinckle thompson became a media critic for the san francisco examiner from the mid1980s until the end of that decade thompson s editor at the examiner david mccumber who would write a mitchell brothers biography not long after jim mitchell fatally shot his brother art in 1991  was reportedly deeply disappointed in the quality of thompson s examiner columns in 1990 former porn director gail palmer visited thompson s home in woody creek she later accused him of sexual assault claiming that he twisted her breast when she refused to join him in the hot tub she also described cocaine use to authorities a six person 11 hour search of thompson s home turned up various kinds of drugs and a few sticks of dynamite all charges were dismissed after a pretrial hearing thompson would later describe this experience at length in kingdom of fear by the early 1990s thompson was said to be working on a novel called polo is my life which was briefly excerpted in rolling stone in 1994 and which thompson himself described in 1996 as a sex book you know sex drugs and rock and roll it s about the manager of a sex theater who s forced to leave and flee to the mountains he falls in love and gets in even more trouble than he was in the sex theater in san francisco the novel was slated to be released by random house in 1999 and was even assigned isbn 0679406948 but was not published thompson continued to contribute irregularly to rolling stone fear and loathing in elko published in 1992 was a wellreceived fictional rallying cry against clarence thomas while mr bill s neighborhood was a largely nonfictional account of an interview with bill clinton in an arkansas diner rather than embarking on the campaign trail as he had done in previous presidential elections thompson monitored the proceedings from cable television better than sex confessions of a political junkie his account of the 1992 presidential election campaign is composed of reactionary faxes sent to rolling stone a decade later he contributed fear and loathing campaign 2004 an account of a road jaunt with john kerry during his presidential campaign that would be thompson s final magazine feature thompson was named a kentucky colonel by the governor of kentucky in a december 1996 tribute ceremony where he also received keys to the city of louisville despite publishing a novel and numerous newspaper and magazine articles the majority of thompson s literary output after the late 1970s took the form of a 4volume series of books called the gonzo papers beginning with the great shark hunt in 1979 and ending with better than sex in 1994 the series is largely a collection of rare newspaper and magazine pieces from the pregonzo period along with almost all of his rolling stone short pieces excerpts from the fear and loathing books and so on by the late 1970s thompson received complaints from critics fans and friends that he was regurgitating his past glories without much new on his part these concerns are alluded to in the introduction of the great shark hunt where thompson suggested that his old self committed suicide perhaps in response to this as well as the strained relationship with rolling stone and the failure of his marriage thompson became more reclusive after 1980 he would often retreat to his compound in woody creek and reject assignments or refuse to complete them despite the dearth of new material wenner kept thompson on the rolling stone masthead as chief of the national affairs desk a position he would hold until his death thompson s work was popularized again with the 1998 release of the film fear and loathing in las vegas which opened to considerable fanfare the novel was reprinted to coincide with the film and thompson s work was introduced to a new generation of readers soon thereafter thompson s long lost novel the rum diary was published as were the first two volumes of his collected letters which were greeted with critical acclaim thompson s next and penultimate collection kingdom of fear was a combination of new material selected newspaper clippings and some older works released in 2003 it was perceived by critics to be an angry vitriolic commentary on the passing of the american century and the state of affairs after the september 2001 attacks hunter married anita bejmuk his longtime assistant on april 23 2003 thompson ended his journalism career in the same way it had begun writing about sports thompson penned a weekly column called hey rube for espn com s page 2 the column ran from 2000 to shortly before his death in 2005 simon schuster bundled many of the columns from the first few years and released it in mid2004 as hey rube blood sport the bush doctrine and the downward spiral of dumbness modern history from the sports desk thompson died at his selfdescribed fortified compound known as owl farm in woody creek colorado at 5 42 pm on february 20 2005 from a selfinflicted gunshot wound to the head thompson s son juan  daughterinlaw jennifer winkel thompson and grandson will thompson were visiting for the weekend at the time of his suicide will and jennifer were in the adjacent room when they heard the gunshot mistaking the shot for the sound of a book falling they continued with their activities for a few minutes before checking on him the police report concerning his death stated that in a typewriter in front of thompson they found a piece of paper carrying the date feb 22 05 and the single word counselor  they reported to the press that they do not believe his suicide was out of desperation but was a wellthought out act resulting from thompson s many painful and chronic medical conditions thompson s wife anita who was at a gym at the time of her husband s death was on the phone with him when he ended his life what family and police describe as a suicide note was written by thompson four days before his death and left for his wife it was later published by rolling stone titled football season is over it read no more games no more bombs no more walking no more fun no more swimming 67 that is 17 years past 50 17 more than i needed or wanted boring i am always bitchy no fun for anybody 67 you are getting greedy act your old age relax this wo nt hurt artist and friend ralph steadman wrote  he told me 25 years ago that he would feel real trapped if he did nt know that he could commit suicide at any moment i do nt know if that is brave or stupid or what but it was inevitable i think that the truth of what rings through all his writing is that he meant what he said if that is entertainment to you well that s ok if you think that it enlightened you well that s even better if you wonder if he s gone to heaven or hell rest assured he will check out them both find out which one richard milhous nixon went to and go there he could never stand being bored but there must be football too and peacocks  on august 20 2005 in a private ceremony thompson s ashes were fired from a cannon atop a tower of his own design in the shape of a doublethumbed fist clutching a peyote button to the tune of norman greenbaum s spirit in the sky and bob dylan s mr tambourine man red white blue and green fireworks were launched along with his ashes as the city of aspen would not allow the cannon to remain for more than a month the cannon has been dismantled and put into storage until a suitable permanent location can be found according to his widow anita thompson s funeral was financed by actor johnny depp a close friend of thompson depp told the associated press all i m doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true i just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out other famous attendees at the funeral included us senator john kerry and former us senator george mcgovern 60 minutes correspondent ed bradley and charlie rose actors jack nicholson bill murray benicio del toro sean penn and josh hartnett singers lyle lovett john oates and numerous other friends an estimated 280 people attended the funeral the plans for this monument were initially drawn by thompson and ralph steadman and were shown as part of an omnibus program on the bbc entitled fear and loathing in gonzovision 1978  it is included as a special feature on the second disc of the 2003 criterion collection dvd release of fear and loathing in las vegas labeled on the dvd as fear and loathing on the road to hollywood  the video footage of steadman and thompson drawing the plans and outdoor footage showing where he wanted the cannon constructed were planned prior to the unveiling of his cannon at the funeral thompson is often credited as the creator of gonzo journalism a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction his work and style are considered to be a major part of the new journalism literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time thompson almost always wrote in the first person while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color the story he was trying to follow his writing aimed to be humorous colorful and bizarre and he often exaggerated events to be more entertaining the term gonzo has since been applied in kind to numerous other forms of highly subjective artistic expression despite his having personally described his work as gonzo it fell to later observers to articulate what the phrase actually meant while thompson s approach clearly involved injecting himself as a participant in the events of the narrative it also involved adding invented metaphoric elements thus creating for the uninitiated reader a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other thompson in a 1974 interview in playboy addressed the issue himself saying unlike tom wolfe or gay talese i almost never try to reconstruct a story they re both much better reporters than i am but then i do nt think of myself as a reporter o tom wolfe would later describe thompson s style as part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric the majority of thompson s most popular and acclaimed work appeared within the pages of rolling stone magazine along with joe eszterhas and david felton thompson was instrumental in expanding the focus of the magazine past music criticism indeed thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine nevertheless his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from howlin wolf to lou reed armed with early fax machines wherever he went he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine s san francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press robert love thompson s editor of 23 years at rolling stone wrote that the dividing line between fact and fancy rarely blurred and we did nt always use italics or some other typographical device to indicate the lurch into the fabulous but if there were living identifiable humans in a scene we took certain steps  hunter was close friends with many prominent democrats veterans of the ten or more presidential campaigns he covered so when in doubt we d call the press secretary people will believe almost any twisted kind of story about politicians or washington  he once said and he was right discerning the line between the fact and the fiction of thompson s work presented a practical problem for editors and factcheckers of his work love called factchecking thompson s work one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world and for the firsttimer a trip through a journalistic fun house where you did nt know what was real and what was nt you knew you had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended hunter was a stickler for numbers for details like gross weight and model numbers for lyrics and caliber and there was no faking it thompson often used a blend of fiction and fact when portraying himself in his writing as well sometimes using the name raoul duke as an author surrogate whom he generally described as a callous erratic selfdestructive journalist who constantly drank alcohol and took hallucinogenic drugs fantasizing about causing bodily harm to others was also a characteristic in his work used to comedic effect and an example of his brand of humor in the late sixties thompson obtained his famous title of doctor from the universal life church he later preferred to be called dr thompson and his alterego raoul duke called himself a doctor of journalism thompson was as fond of personae as wc fields besides raoul duke thompson also toyed with the idea of taking the names jefferson rank gene skinner and sebastian owl for various purposes literary and nonliterary naming his compound in woody creek colorado owl farm after the last of these a number of critics have commented that as he grew older the line that distinguished thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred thompson himself admitted during a 1978 bbc interview that he sometimes felt pressured to live up to the fictional self that he had created adding i m never sure which one people expect me to be very often they conflict most often as a matter of fact  i m leading a normal life and right along side me there is this myth and it is growing and mushrooming and getting more and more warped when i get invited to say speak at universities i m not sure if they are inviting duke or thompson i m not sure who to be thompson s writing style and eccentric persona gave him a cult following in both literary and drug circles and his cult status expanded into broader areas after being twice portrayed in major motion pictures hence both his writing style and persona have been widely imitated and his likeness has even become a popular costume choice for halloween in the documentary breakfast with hunter hunter s thompson is seen in several scenes wearing different che guevara tshirts additionally actor and friend benicio del toro has stated that thompson kept a big picture of che in his kitchen thompson wrote passionately on behalf of african american rights and the african american civil rights movement he strongly criticised the dominance in american society of what he called white power structures he was a proponent of the right to bear arms and privacy rights a member of the national rifle association thompson was also cocreator of the fourth amendment foundation an organization to assist victims in defending themselves against unwarranted search and seizure part of his work with the fourth amendment foundation centered around support of lisl auman a colorado woman who was sentenced for life in 1997 under felony murder charges for the death of police officer bruce vanderjagt despite contradictory statements and dubious evidence thompson organized rallies provided legal support and cowrote an article in the june 2004 issue of vanity fair outlining the case the colorado supreme court eventually overturned auman s sentence in march 2005 shortly after thompson s death and auman is now free auman s supporters claim thompson s support and publicity resulted in the successful appeal thompson was a firearms and explosives enthusiast in his writing and in real life and owned a vast collection of handguns rifles shotguns and various automatic and semiautomatic weapons along with numerous forms of gaseous crowd control and many other homemade devices thompson was also an ardent supporter of drug legalization and became known for his lessthanshy accounts of his own drug usage he was an early supporter of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws and served on the group s advisory board for over 30 years until his death he told an interviewer in 1997 that drugs should be legalized across the board it might be a little rough on some people for a while but i think it s the only way to deal with drugs look at prohibition all it did was make a lot of criminals rich after the september 11 2001 attacks thompson voiced skepticism regarding the official story on who was responsible for the attacks he suggested to several interviewers that it may have been conducted by the us government or with the government s assistance in 2002 thompson told a radio show host you sort of wonder when something like that happens well who stands to benefit who had the opportunity and the motive you just kind of look at these basic things i saw that the us government was going to benefit and the white house people the republican administration to take the mind of the public off the crashing economy  and i have spent enough time on the inside of well in the white house and you know campaigns and i ve known enough people who do these things think this way to know that the public version of the news or whatever event is never really what happened in 2004 thompson regarding politics wrote nixon was a professional politician and i despised everything he stood for but if he were running for president this year against the evil bushcheney gang i would happily vote for him thompson wrote many letters and they were his primary means of personal conversation thompson made carbon copies of all his letters usually typed a habit that began in his teenage years his letters were sent to friends public officials and reporters some of his letters have begun to be published in a series of books called the fear and loathing letters the first volume the proud highway saga of a desperate southern gentleman 1955 1967 is over 650 pages while the second volume fear and loathing in america the brutal odyssey of an outlaw journalist passed 700 douglas brinkley who edits the letter series said that for every letter included fifteen were cut brinkley estimated thompson s own archive to contain over 20000 letters according to amazon com the last of the three planned volumes of thompson s letters was allegedly to be published on january 1 2007 as the mutineer rants ravings and missives from the mountaintop 19772005 anita thompson has said on herblog that the collection will be released sometime in february amazon com currently lists the publication date on its site as february 1 2011 many biographies have been written about thompson although he did not write an autobiography but his letters contained asides to his biographers that he assumed could be reading in on his collected letters some of these letters were already bundled into thompson s kingdom of fear though it is not considered an autobiography accompanying the eccentric and colorful writing of hunter thompson illustrations by british artist ralph steadman offer visual representations of the gonzo style steadman and thompson developed a close friendship and often traveled together though his illustrations occur in most of thompson s books they are conspicuously featured in full page color in thompson s the curse of lono set in hawaii thompson was an avid amateur photographer throughout his life and his photos have been exhibited since his death at art galleries in the united states and united kingdom in late 2006 ammo books published a limitededition 224 page collection of thompson photos called gonzo with an introduction by johnny depp thompson s snapshots were a combination of the subjects he was covering stylized selfportraits and artistic still life photos the london observer called the photos astonishingly good and that thompson s pictures remind us brilliantly in every sense of very real people real colours the film where the buffalo roam 1980 depicts thompson s attempts at writing stories for both the super bowl and the 1972 us presidential election it stars bill murray as thompson and peter boyle as thompson s attorney oscar acosta referred to in the movie

thompson s persona before assuming his role in the film as hunter thompson raoul duke and benicio del toro as oscar acosta referred to in the movie as dr gonzo the film has achieved something of a

suicide and march 12 2005 doonesbury ran a tribute to hunter with uncle duke lamenting the death of the man he called his inspiration o the first of these strips featured a panel with artwork similar

of blood or oxygen to a baby s brain during birth is a major cause of death and brain damage occurring in approximately 1 per 1000 births and causing around 20 of all cases of cerebral palsy brain hypothermia induced by cooling a baby to around 33 degrees c for 3 days after birth has recently been proven to be the only medical intervention which reduces brain damage and improves an infant s chance of normal survival after birth asphyxia many physicians over the centuries have tried to resuscitate babies after birth by altering their body temperatures essentially aiming to animate the infant by inducing the onset of breathing little thought was given to brain protection because cerebral hypoxia during birth was not linked with later neurological problems until william john little in 1861 and even then this was controversial sigmund freud for example famously disagreed and when scientific studies of neonatal therapeutic hypothermia were begun in the 1950s researchers like bjorn westin still reported their work in terms of reanimation rather than neuroprotection investigators such as james miller and clement smith carried out clinical observations and careful physiological experiments but although some babies were conscientiously followed up they were not mainly concerned with long term neurological outcome however by the 1960s physicians saw hypothermia after delivery was something to be avoided the problem of infants who failed to breath at birth had been solved by the invention of mechanical ventilation so any benefit cooling might have for reanimation was no longer needed and an influential trial showed that keeping small and preterm infants warm increased survival these results together with observational and experimental data made it an article of medical faith for decades that babies should not be allowed to get cold consequently during the next two decades studies of neonatal hypothermia in europe and the usa were sporadic and often unsuccessful an interest in cooling for brain protection was beginning to emerge but contemporary neuroscience provided few useful concepts to guide this research and little progress was made  although across the iron curtain in the soviet union cooling was being applied empirically following birth asphyxia the language barrier cold war politics and the russians failure to carry out randomised controlled trials contributed to an almost total ignorance of this work in the west indeed a group of russian neonatologists who described hypothermic neural rescue during a visit to the neonatal unit in bristol uk met with little interest in the late 1980s the development of a new set of concepts and problems led to a reexamination a new generation of neonatal researchers were influenced by the growing evidence that protecting the brain against the effects of oxygen deprivation during labour might be possible these researchers were aware that cooling produced powerful intraischaemic neuroprotection during cardiac surgery but a new concept of hypothermic postinsult neural rescue developed this shift in thinking was possible because of at least three major new ideas that were developing at the same time delayed postischaemic cell death excitotoxicity and apoptosis the first paradigm shift that affected neonatal researchers in particular was the idea that if a baby was resuscitated after cerebral hypoxiaischaemia there was a period of time before brain cells started to die osmund reynolds at university college london used the newly developed technique of magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs to show that the infant brain metabolism is normal in the hours after birth asphyxia and deteriorated only after a distinct delay robert vannucci confirmed the effect with painstaking biochemistry and delayed injury was also reported in neuropathological studies delayed brain injury called secondary energy failure by reynolds was a critical new idea if brain cells remained normal for a time and the mechanism of the delayed death could be unravelled it opened the possibility of therapeutic intervention in what had previously seemed an impossible situation the new and transforming concept of excitotoxicity developed from the seminal experiments of john olney and brian meldrum they showed that at least some of the neural cell death caused by hypoxiaischaemia is mediated by excess production of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and that pharmacological blockade of the nmethyldaspartate receptor could provide good protection against hypoxic damage olney and meldrum had shifted the paradigm allowing researchers to think of hypoxicischaemic damage as a treatable disease however it was still a mystery how and why cells triggered by hypoxiaischaemia should die hours or days later particularly when it became clear that glutamate levels were not particularly high during secondary energy failure the next critical idea came with the discovery of programmed cell death a novel form of cell suicide originally observed as a pathological appearance and named apoptosis verb falling off as of leaves in the 1970 s horvitz raff and evan provided a molecular understanding and showed that apoptosis could be triggered by cellular insults the radical idea that hypoxiaischaemia triggered a cell suicide programme which could explain the perplexing phenomenon of delayed cell death was soon supported by experimental and human data and many researchers believe this helps explain why neural rescue works in the newborn however the picture is complex both apoptosis and necrosis are present in variable proportions and there seems to be prolonged neurodegeneration after an insult research into this problem continues these ideas flowed through the perinatal research community producing a new belief that neural rescue after birth asphyxia should be possible amongst the first to have attempt neonatal neural rescue in animals were ingmar kjellmer and henrik hagberg in gothenburg and michael johnston in baltimore the potential began to draw in other neonatal researchers from diverse fields to begin neuroprotection research including those who came to form the informal neonatal hypothermia research group peter gluckman and tania gunn were endocrinologists in the university of auckland new zealand and interested in cooling for its effect on thyroid function they had first cooled a sheep fetus for endocrine studies in 1983 denis azzopardi john wyatt and david edwards then young researchers working for reynolds were using reynolds s sophisticated mrs approach to replicate secondary energy failure in newborn piglets and immature rats in gluckman s laboratory alistair gunn and chris williams developed a simple and elegant biophysical method using cerebral impedance to do essentially the same thing in fetal sheep marianne thoresen who was working on cerebral perfusion was prompted to think about neuroprotection by stories of children who fell through the norwegian ice and suffering prolonged drowning in iced water but emerged with preserved cerebral function there were many potential therapies around which might achieve neural rescue and most of these workers did not immediately move to hypothermia magnesium was an appealingly simple excitoxin receptor antagonist that protected cells in culture the reynolds group tested it in their piglet model without success gluckman and gunn started by looking unsuccessfully at flunarizine a calcium entry inhibitor edwards picked on nitric oxide synthase inhibition which was also a failure gluckman had success with his innovative studies of igf1 but could not immediately translate this to clinical practice most neonatal researchers recognise work published in 1989 from myron ginsberg s group as starting point of their interest in postinsult hypothermia ginsberg showed that a short period of hypothermia after hypoxiaischaemia in adult rats produced significant protection in the hippocampus soon pusanelli s group suggested that at least some of the strong neuroprotective effect of the canonical glutamate antagonist mk801 was by reducing body temperature before long there was a significant body of experimental work on postischaemic neuroprotection by hypothermia in mature animals these results also stimulated clinical scientists working with adults who had apparent early success in clinical trials the informal neonatal hypothermia interest group was developing gluckman visited london reynolds and wyatt went to oslo edwards went to auckland and thoresen contacted westin then went to work in the reynolds laboratory over the next year or so together and separately they produced a series of reports in piglets immature rats and fetal sheep which showed repeatedly that postinsult hypothermia significantly reduced hypoxicischaemic brain damage in the developing brain trying to understand how and why cooling might work they showed that it specifically reduced apoptosis and interrupted the excitiotoxic cascade thoresen recalls the immediacy of the first hypothermia experiment in the reynolds laboratory the room was full and she watched with reynolds wyatt edwards and others as the biomarkers remained stubbornly normal after a very severe hypoxic insult which would normally have caused catastrophic secondary energy failure in new zealand there were similar experiences gunn says that he realised that hypothermia was going to work during his third experiment as he watched the expected delayed injury fail to materialise as the experimental data continued to accumulate clinical pilot studies were already being organised although with some trepidation because of the prevailing view that cold was very dangerous for infants there was some controversy over the relative benefits of selective head against whole body cooling tania and alistair gunn first out of the clinical blocks set out in auckland to study local head cooling which they argued would have fewer side effects edwards and azzopardi now based at hammersmith hospital delayed clinical studies until they had used a computer model to decide between the two then started whole body cooling thoresen and andrew whitelaw relocated from oslo to bristol tried both methods cooling was now a topic of wider discussion in the neonatal community and other groups started to organise further experimental and further preliminary clinical studies  reviewed in jacobs et al  however not everyone was convinced the highly respected vannucci laboratory had failed to find any protective effect of postinsult cooling and worse ginsberg s group reported that hypothermic protection in mature rats was only temporary many clinicians thought that the experiments models were over simplistic and unrepresentitive of the complex clinical situation others thought that brain damage might have occurred weeks or months earlier although an mri study from hammersmith dispelled this myth nevertheless cooling captured the imagination of one of the most influential figures in neonatal medicine jerry lucey the editor of the toprated pediatric journal pediatrics had an extraordinary ability to spot new ideas and he became a strong champion of cooling he promoted hypothermia tirelessly and in early 1997 made a critical introduction between olympic medical a medium sized equipment company and the cooling fraternity in 1997 in his car on the way to dulles international airport after a series of meetings largely organised by lucey jay jones the owner of olympic medical decided to fund a randomised controlled trial of hypothermic neural rescue therapy in newborn infants olympic would construct a head cooling device the olympic coolcap system and provide practical and financial support for the trial gluckman and wyatt would be principal investigators and the scientific committee which developed and ran the trial joined hypothermia researchers like edwards and whitelaw with new experts donna ferriero richard polin roberta ballard and charlene robertson the newcomers were not all convinced babycoolers ferriero also a distinguished neuroprotection experimentalist was particularly sceptical but they brought a range of new skills essential to taking hypothermia into a major randomised trial arguably the most important roles in delivering the trial were taken by ted weiler an indefatigable engineer from olympic medical and gunn who became the scientific officer the coolcap study studied cooling for 72 hours started within 6 hours of delivery the protocol was based on the auckland pilot studies but was somewhat arbitrary the relative merits of different temperatures or lengths of cooling were unclear and the researchers used best estimates based on their animal experiments cautiously choosing the upper band of the expected therapeutic range noone knew with certainty what effect size to predicit or even what the best primary outcome was on the divisive question of selective head versus whole body cooling in the almost total absence of useful data they compromised and used rectal temperature to control a head cooling device coolcap thus studied the effect of cooling the whole baby to 34 5oc with the expectation some said hope that the brain might be a degree or so cooler the first infant was enrolled at columbia presbyterian medical center new york on july 1 1999 and all data were collected audited and prepared for analysis by fall 2003 the result was reported at lucey s annual washington dc hot topics in neonatology meeting in december 2003 with full publication in the lancet in 2005 coolcap showed a nonsignificant trend to improvement with cooling in the primary outcome of death or disability at 18 months overall but a clear and significant benefit when infants with very severe or long established brain injury were excluded this was not quite the definitive result they hoped for but the researchers remained resolute gluckman confided to edwards as they relaxed together after the data presentation in washington that he thought they would never do more important work after the coolcap trial another major study was published by the national institute for child health and human development nichd neonatal research network the coolcap researchers had previously had lengthy discussions with the network about collaboration because although the network had no experience of hypothermia they had a strong track record of patient recruitment however after detailed discussions around the final coolcap protocol broke down the network began a separate trial led by seetha shankaran some network members were setting up animal models of hypothermic neural rescue providing valuable experience for preliminary experiments the nichd trial found a significant effect of cooling although the study was criticised in some quarters for temperature instability in the control group the question which now faced the community was should cooling become standard of care opinions were divided some observers thought the evidence was sufficient particularly if the growing number of pilot or smaller studies were considered and in december 2006 the us food and drug administration fda approved the olympic coolcap system for clinical use however others pointed out that the results were at best statistically marginal and urged scepticism worryingly hypothermia trials for head trauma in adults and older children were failing to show benefit a review meeting organised by nichd advised that cooling was an emerging therapy but not standard of care the community awaited more data after a couple of years during which even the original researchers found it difficult always to agree the last major trial that had grown out of the original experimentalist group was completed the total body hypothermia for pernatal asphyxia trial toby  led by azzopardi backed by distinguished trials specialist peter brocklehurst and theâ uk national perinatal epidemiology unit developed from the hammersmith pilot study of whole body cooling but collected the data needed to allow metaanalysis with both coolcap and the nichd studies toby had the advantage of being delayed in starting by the funding timetable of the uk medical research council so that it was still in progress when coolcap and the nichd trial reported marginal benefits making it clear that the trial size should be increased when toby reported it was considerably larger than either previous study and yet showed remarkable consistency with both those trials the point estimate for effect was similar and metaanalysis detailed below showed unequivocally that cooling increases an infants chance of surviving without neurological deficits at 18 months and reduces neurodevelopmental impairment in survival the memories of some of the researchers involved in bringing hypothermic neural rescue into clinical practice have recently been collated much of what is known about the mechanisms of hypothermic neuroprotection is gathered from studies in mature and adult models what follows uses some of these data while trying to focus on the immature brain more information particularly on adults is given in the article therapeutic hypothermia cerebral hypoxiaischaemia results in reduced cerebral oxidative metabolism cerebral lactic acidosis and cell membrane ionic transport failure if prolonged there is necrotic cell death although rapid recovery of cerebral energy metabolism occurs following successful resuscitation this is followed some hours later by a secondary fall in cerebral high energy phosphates accompanied by a rise in intracellular ph and the characteristic cerebral biochemical disturbance at this stage is a lactic alkalosis in neonates the severity of this secondary impairment in cerebral metabolism are associated with abnormal subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome and reduced head growth several adverse biological events contribute to this secondary deterioration including release of excitatory amino acids which activate nmethyldaspartate nmda and amino3hydroxy5methyl4isoxazolepropionate ampa receptors on neurons 3037 and oligodendroglial precursors accumulation of excitatory neurotransmitters generation of reactive oxygen radicals intracellular calcium accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction whilst necrotic cell death is prominent in the immediate and acute phases of severe cerebral insults the predominant mode of death during the delayed phase of injury appears to be apoptosis neuroprotective mechanisms need to interact with these mechanisms to have beneficial effect newborn hypoxicischaemic brain injury differs from injury in the adult brain in several ways nmda receptor toxicity is much higher in the immature brain apoptotic mechanisms including activation of caspases translocation of apoptosisinducing factor and cytochromec release are much greater in the immature than the adult the inflammatory activation is different with less contribution from polymorphonuclear cells and a more prominent role of il18 whereas il1 which is critical in the adult brain is less important the antioxidant system is underdeveloped with reduced capacity to inactivate hydrogen peroxide mild hypothermia helps prevent disruptions to cerebral metabolism both during and following cerebral insults hypothermia decreases the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and oxygen and reduces the loss of high energy phosphates during hypoxiaischaemia and during secondary cerebral energy failure and reduces delayed cerebral lactic alkalosis the simultaneous increase in cytotoxic oedema and loss of cerebral cortical activity that accompanies secondary energy failure is also prevented hypothermia appears to have multiple effects at a cellular level following cerebral injury hypothermia reduces vasogenic oedema haemorrhage and neutrophil infiltration after trauma the release of excitatory neurotransmitters is reduced limiting intracellular calcium accumulation free radical production is lessened which protects cells and cellular organelles from oxidative damage during reperfusion in addition mild hypothermia may reduce the activation of the cytokine and coagulation cascades through increased activation of suppressor signalling pathways and by inhibiting release of platelet activating factor many of the effects induced by mild hypothermia may help to reduce the number of cells undergoing apoptosis experimental and clinical studies indicate that the number of apoptotic neurons is reduced caspase activity is lessened and cytochrome c translocation is diminished by mild hypothermia and there may be an increase in expression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl2 approximately 1000 patients have now been studied in randomised controlled trials of hypothermia there is ongoing surveillance of hypothermiatreated patients through the toby registry in the united kingdom and also some data collection of neonatal encephalopathy data by the vermontoxford database in the united states it is possible therefore to reach some firm conclusions on the clinical value of hypothermia a number of randomised controlled trials have now been carried out early synthesis of the available data by the cochrane collaboration suggested that there was a beneficial effect but did not provide unequivocal support for general application however a metaanalysis of all studies published in late 2009 included new data in particular the toby trial and this provided conclusive evidence that cooling reduces the adverse effects of birth asphyxia this analysis found three trials the coolcap nichd and toby trials which measured neurological outcome at least 18 months after birth these trials report a total of 767 infants taken together they showed a significant benefit of cooling with a significant reduction in death or disability at 18 months after birth typical risk ratio 081 95 confidence intervals 071 093  p 0002 treatment with hypothermia was consistently associated with an increased rate of normal survival survival typical risk ratio 153 95 confidence intervals 122 193  p 0001 there was a significant reduction in cerebral palsy amongst infants treated with hypothermia compared with controls the relative effects of selective head and whole body cooling seem indistinguishable 11 trials reported mortality rates after cooling metaanalysis of these data showed that fewer infants treated with prolonged moderate hypothermia died typical risk ratio 078 95 confidence interval 066 093 p 0004 while most observers currently regard hypothermic neural rescue therapy as an evidencebased clinical treatment which increases any individual child s chance of surviving without brain damage detectable at 18 months by about 50 there remains much that is unknown longterm followup is in progress to ensure that the benefits persist although an imaging study nested in toby also found reduced brain tissue damage in cooled infants which is encouraging it is not clear if cooling initiated later will be beneficial and the nichd network has set out to investigate this the ice trial a pragmatic study which emphasises the role of transport is awaited trials are beginning of therapies added to cooling such as xenon gas or erythropoietin the simplicity which attracted empyricists to cooling centuries ago now makes hypothermic neural rescue a potentially transforming therapy for lowresource environments where birth asphyxia remains a major cause of death and disability ironically this brings back the problem of cooling infants in an environment where modern resuscitation and intensive care are not available  influences on karl marx are commonly referred to as deriving from three sources german idealist philosophy french socialism and english scottish political economy although this three sources imwecompoundnoun model is an oversimplification it still has some measure of truth immanuel kant is believed to have had the greatest influence of any philosopher of modern times kantian philosophy was the basis on which the structure of marxism was built particularly as it was developed by georg hegel hegel s dialectical method which was taken up by karl marx was an extension of the method of reasoning by antinomies that kant used g w f hegel by the time of his death was the most prominent philosopher in germany his views were widely taught and his students were highly regarded his followers soon divided into rightwing and leftwing hegelians theologically and politically the rightwing hegelians offered a conservative interpretation of his work they emphasized the compatibility between hegel s philosophy and christianity politically they were orthodox the leftwing hegelians eventually moved to an atheistic position in politics many of them became revolutionaries this historically important leftwing group included ludwig feuerbach bruno bauer friedrich engels and marx they were often referred to as the young hegelians marx s view of history which came to be called historical materialism is certainly influenced by hegel s claim that reality and history should be viewed dialectically hegel believed that the direction of human history is characterized in the movement from the fragmentary toward the complete and the real which was also a movement towards greater and greater rationality  sometimes hegel explained this progressive unfolding of the absolute involves gradual evolutionary accretion but at other times requires discontinuous revolutionary leaps episodal upheavals against the existing status quo for example hegel strongly opposed slavery in the united states during his lifetime and he envisioned a time when christian nations would radically eliminate it from their civilization while marx accepted this broad conception of history hegel was an idealist and marx sought to rewrite dialectics in materialist terms he summarized the materialistic aspect of his theory of history in the 1859 preface to a contribution to the critique of political economy in this brief popularization of his ideas marx emphasized that social development sprang from the inherent contradictions within material life and the social superstructure this notion is often understood as a simple historical narrative primitive communism had developed into slave states slave states had developed into feudal societies those societies in turn became capitalist states and those states would be overthrown by the selfconscious portion of their workingclass or proletariat creating the conditions for socialism and ultimately a higher form of communism than that with which the whole process began marx illustrated his ideas most prominently by the development of capitalism from feudalism and by the prediction of the development of socialism from capitalism ludwig feuerbach was a german philosopher and anthropologist according to feuerbach social and political thought should take as their foundation people and their material needs he held that an individual is the product of their environment that the whole consciousness of a person is the result of the interaction of sensory organs and the external world marx and engels saw in feuerbach s emphasis on people and human needs a movement toward a materialistic interpretation of society in the essence of christianity feuerbach argued that god is really a creation of man and that the qualities people attribute to god are really qualities of humanity accordingly marx argued that it is the material world that is real and that our ideas of it are consequences not causes of the world thus like hegel and other philosophers marx distinguished between appearances and reality however he did not believe that the material world hides from us the real world of the ideal on the contrary he thought that historically and socially specific ideology prevented people from seeing the material conditions of their lives clearly what distinguished marx from feuerbach was his view of feuerbach s humanism as excessively abstract and so no less ahistorical and idealist than what it purported to replace namely the reified notion of god found in institutional christianity that legitimized the repressive power of the prussian state instead marx aspired to give ontological priority to what he called the real life process of real human beings as he and engels said in the german ideology 1846  also in his theses on feuerbach 1844  he writes that the philosophers have only described the world in various ways the point is to change it this opposition between firstly various subjective interpretations given by philosophers which may be in a sense compared with weltanschauung designed to legitimize the current state of affairs and secondly the effective transformation of the world through praxis which combines theory and practice in a materialist way is what distinguishes marxist philosophers from the rest of philosophers indeed marx s break with german idealism involves a new definition of philosophy louis althusser founder of structural marxism in the 1960s would define it as class struggle in theory marx s movement away from university philosophy and towards the workers movement is thus inextricably linked to his rupture with his earlier writings which pushed marxist commentators to speak of a young marx and a mature marx although the nature of this cut poses problems a year before the revolutions of 1848 marx and engels thus wrote the communist manifesto which was prepared to an imminent revolution and ended with the famous cry proletarians of all countries unite however marx s thought changed again following louisnapoleon bonaparte s december 2 1851 coup which put an end to the french second republic and created the second empire which would last until the 1870 francoprussian war marx thereby modified his theory of alienation exposed in the economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 and would latter arrive to his theory of commodity fetishism exposed in the first chapter of the first book of das kapital 1867  this abandonment of the early theory of alienation would be amply discussed several marxist theorists including marxist humanists such as the praxis school would return to it others such as althusser would claim that the epistemological break between the young marx and the mature marx was such that no comparisons could be done between both works marking a shift to a scientific theory of society marx did not study directly with hegel but after hegel died marx studied under one of hegel s pupils bruno bauer a leader of the circle of young hegelians to whom marx attached himself however marx and engels came to disagree with bruno bauer and the rest of the young hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of hegel s dialectic from 1841 the young marx progressively broke away from german idealism and the young hegelians along with engels who observed the chartist movement in the united kingdom he cut away with the environment in which he grew up and encountered the proletariat in france and germany he then wrote a scathing criticism of the young hegelians in two books the holy family 1845  and the german ideology 1845  in which he criticized not only bauer but also max stirner s the ego and its own 1844  considered as one of the founding book of individualist anarchism max stirner claimed that all ideals were inherently alienating and that replacing god by the humanity as did ludwig feuerbach in the essence of christianity 1841  was not sufficient according to stirner any ideals god humanity the nation or even the revolution alienated the ego marx also criticized proudhon whom had become famous with his cry property is theft in the poverty of philosophy 1845  marx s early writings are thus a response towards hegel german idealism and a break with the rest of the young hegelians marx stood hegel on his head in his own view of his role by turning the idealistic dialectic into a materialistic one in proposing that material circumstances shape ideas instead of the other way around in this marx was following the lead of feuerbach his theory of alienation developed in the economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 published in 1932  inspired itself from feuerbach s critique of the alienation of man in god through the objectivation of all his inherent characteristics thus man projected on god all qualities which are in fact man s own quality which defines the human nature  but marx also criticized feuerbach for being insufficiently materialistic as stirner himself had point out and explained that the alienation described by the young hegelians was in fact the result of the structure of the economy itself furthermore he criticized feuerbach s conception of human nature in his sixth thesis on feuerbach as an abstract kind which incarnated itself in each singular individual feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man menschliche wesen human nature  but the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual in reality it is the ensemble of the social relations o thereupon instead of founding itself on the singular concrete individual subject as did classic philosophy including contractualism hobbes locke and rousseau but also political economy marx began with the totality of social relations labour language and all which constitute our human existence he claimed that individualism was an essence the result of commodity fetishism or alienation although some critics have claimed that meant that marx enforced a strict social determinism which destroyed the possibility of free will marx s philosophy in no way can be reduced to such determinism as his own personal trajectory makes clear in 18445 when marx was starting to settle his account with hegel and the young hegelians in his writings he critiqued the young hegelians for limiting the horizon of their critique to religion and not taking up the critique of the state and civil society as paramount indeed in 1844 by the look of marx s writings in that period most famous of which is the economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 a text that most explicitly elaborated his theory of alienation  marx s thinking could have taken at least three possible courses the study of law religion and the state the study of natural philosophy and the study of political economy he chose the last as the predominant focus of his studies for the rest of his life largely on account of his previous experience as the editor of the newspaper rheinische zeitung on whose pages he fought for freedom of expression against prussian censorship and made a rather idealist legal defense for the moselle peasants customary right of collecting wood in the forest this right was at the point of being criminalized and privatized by the state  it was marx s inability to penetrate beneath the legal and polemical surface of the latter issue to its materialist economic and social roots that prompted him to critically study political economy political economy predates the 20th century division of the two disciplines of politics and economics treating social relations and economic relations as interwoven marx built on and critiqued the most wellknown political economists of his day the british classical political economists from adam smith came the idea that the grounds of property is labour marx critiqued smith and ricardo for not realizing that their economic concepts reflected specifically capitalist institutions not innate natural properties of human society and could not be applied unchanged to all societies he proposed a systematic correlation between labourvalues and money prices he claimed that the source of profits under capitalism is value added by workers not paid out in wages this mechanism operated through the distinction between labour power which workers freely exchanged for their wages and labour over which assetholding capitalists thereby gained control this practical and theoretical distinction was marx s primary insight and allowed him to develop the concept of surplus value which distinguished his works from that of adam smith and david ricardo workers create enough value during a short period of the working day to pay their wages for that day necessary labour  however they continue to work for several more hours and continue to create value surplus labour  this value is not returned to them but appropriated by the capitalists thus it is not the capitalist ruling class that creates wealth but the workers the capitalists then appropriating this wealth to themselves  some of marx s insights were seen in a rudimentary form by the ricardian socialist school  he developed this theory of exploitation in capital a critique of political economy a dialectical investigation into the forms value relations take marx s theory of business cycles of economic growth and development especially in two sector models and of the declining rate of profit or crisis theory are other important elements of marx s political economy marx later made tentative movements towards econometric investigations of his ideas but the necessary statistical techniques of national accounting only emerged in the following century in any case it has proved difficult to adapt marx s economic concepts which refer to social relations to measurable aggregated stocks and flows in recent decades however a loose quantitative school of marxist economists has emerged while it may be impossible to find exact measures of marx s variables from price data approximations of basic trends are possible rousseau was one of the first modern writers to seriously attack the institution of private property and therefore is sometimes considered a forebear of modern socialism and communism though marx rarely mentions rousseau in his writings he argued that the goal of government should be to secure freedom equality and justice for all within the state regardless of the will of the majority from jeanjacques rousseau came the idea of egalitarian democracy in 1833 france was experiencing a number of social problems arising out of the industrial revolution a number of sweeping plans of reform were developed by thinkers on the left among the more grandiose were the plans of charles fourier and the followers of saintsimon fourier wanted to replace modern cities with utopian communities while the saintsimonians advocated directing the economy by manipulating credit although these programs did nt have much support they did expand the political and social imagination of their contemporaries including marx louis blanc is perhaps best known for originating the social principle later adopted by marx of how labor and income should be distributed from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs pierrejoseph proudhon participated in the february 1848 uprising and the composition of what he termed the first republican proclamation of the new republic but he had misgivings about the new government because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socioeconomic reform which proudhon considered basic proudhon published his own perspective for reform solution du probleme social in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers he believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers it was proudhon s book what is property that convinced the young karl marx that private property should be abolished in one of his first works the holy family marx said not only does proudhon write in the interest of the proletarians he is himself a proletarian an ouvrier his work is a scientific manifesto of the french proletariat o marx however disagreed with proudhon s anarchism and later published vicious criticisms of proudhon marx wrote the poverty of philosophy as a refutation of proudhon s the philosophy of poverty in his socialism proudhon was followed by mikhail bakunin after bakunin s death his libertarian socialism diverged into anarchist communism and collectivist anarchism with notable proponents such as peter kropotkin and joseph dã©jacque marx s revision of hegelianism was also influenced by engels book the condition of the working class in england in 1844 which led marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution thereafter engels and marx worked together for the rest of marx s life so that the collected works of marx and engels are generally published together almost as if the output of one person important publications such as the german ideology and the communist manifesto were joint efforts engels says i cannot deny that both before and during my 40 years collaboration with marx i had a certain independent share in laying the foundation of the theory and more particularly in its elaboration o but he adds marx was influenced by antique materialism especially epicurus to whom marx dedicated his thesis difference of natural philosophy between democritus and epicurus  1841 for his materialism and theory of clinamen which opened up a realm of liberty marx drew on lewis h morgan and his social evolution theory he wrote a collection of notebooks from his reading of lewis morgan but they are regarded as being quite obscure and only available in scholarly editions giambattista vico propounded a cyclical theory of history according to which human societies progress through a series of stages from barbarism to civilization and then return to barbarism in the first stage called the age of the gods religion the family and other basic institutions emerge in the succeeding age of heroes the common people are kept in subjection by a dominant class of nobles in the final stage the age of men the people rebel and win equality but in the process society begins to disintegrate the connection between vico s theory of history and marx s account of the evolution of society is apparent marx read darwin s the origin of species and recognized its value in supporting his theory of class struggle he even sent darwin a personally inscribed copy of das kapital in 1873 marx understood that darwin s work both helped to explain the internal struggles of human society and provided a material explanation for the processes of nature in 1861 karl marx wrote to his friend ferdinand lassalle darwin s work is most important and suits my purposein that it provides a basis in natural science for the historical class struggle  despite all shortcomings it is here that for the first time teleology in natural science is not only dealt a mortal blow but itsrational meaning is empirically explained having read darwin s work and mentioned darwin by name in das kapital it is presumable that marx may have been influencedto some degree by darwin however the depth of the influence if any would certainly seem to be greatly exaggerated by a numberof religious fundamentalists who seek to paint darwin s ideas as incredibly dangerous there is nomention of darwin or evolution in the communist manifesto not surprising since darwin s on the origin of species was published in 1859 11 years later and the only reference to darwin in das kapital amounts to short footnotes on technological specialization in manufacturing and industry despite this in the disasters darwinism brought to humanity harun yahya a muslim creationist writes karl marx the founder of communism adapted darwin s ideas which deeply influenced him to the dialectic process of history o yahya also writes marx revealed his sympathy for darwin by dedicating his most important work das kapital to him this last bit is a common misconception that arose from a letter from darwin to edward aveling  who later became the lover of marx s daughter eleanor  aveling had written to darwin about wanting to dedicatehis book to him but darwin declined and darwin s response became mixed with karl marx s papers when eleanormarx inherited her father s papers from engels the letter was published in 1931 in the russian communistmagazine under the banner of marxism which went on to suggest that the enclosures referred to in theletter might have been chapters from das kapital that dealt with evolution it was not until 1975that aveling s letter to darwin was discovered debunking this myth  john andreas widtsoe  31 january 1872 29 november 1952 was a member of the quorum of the twelve apostles of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints lds church from 1921 until his death widtsoe was also a noted author scientist and academician widtsoe was born on the island of frã¸ya in sã¸rtrã¸ndelag norway at birth his hand was attached to the side of his head but he survived the operation to fix this problem when widtsoe was two his family moved to the norwegian mainland city of namsos his father also named john died in february 1878 this left his mother anna as a widow with two young sons to take care of widtsoe who was then five and his little brother osborne widtsoe after this the family moved to trondheim here his mother was introduced to the lds church by a shoemaker in 1883 widtsoe immigrated to the united states with his mother and brother they made it to utah territory in midnovember widtsoe was baptized a member of the lds church the following april widtsoe graduated from brigham young college in logan utah he then attended harvard university graduating with honors in 1894 he served as the head of the agricultural experiment station at utah state agricultural college he married leah dunford a granddaughter of brigham young she held a degree in home economics and the two of them worked together in extension efforts he taught farmers better farming skills and she taught their wives how to better utilize what they got from the farm in 1898 he was ordained to the office of a seventy and set apart to do missionary work in connection with his studies in europe he entered the university of gã¶ttingen germany and after applying himself diligently to his studies he graduated from that institution with the degrees of a m phd in 1899 for part of his time in europe widtsoe lived in switzerland the police wanted proof that he and his wife were married and since they had neglected to bring their wedding license they got married a second time in august 1900 widtsoe became the director of the agricultural experiment station at what is now utah state university while in this position he founded the deseret farmer with lewis a merrill and j edward taylor their goal was to have it be a popular magazine that would be read and implemented by the actual farmers in 1905 widtsoe was dismissed from the agricultural college as a result of political debates about its future and president william j kerr s feeling that widtsoe was insufficiently supporting him for a short time he was a professor of agriculture at byu and is arguably the founding father of brigham young university s college of biology and agriculture on byu campus the john a widtsoe building is the home of the college of biology and agriculture soon however he returned to logan to succeed kerr as president of utah state university from 1907 to 1916 he also served as the president of the university of utah from 1916 until his call as a member of the quorum of the twelve in 1921 widtsoe was the fifth commissioner of church education from 1921 to 1924 and was the seventh commissioner from 1934 to 1936 during his time as an apostle widtsoe taught a religion class at the university of southern california for two years in the 1920s widtsoe lived in washington d c where he supervised the reorganization of the federal bureau of reclamation widtsoe was closely associated with the improvement era even before he became an apostle widtsoe was associate editor of the era from 1935 until 1952 while editor of the era in the words of parrish widtsoe directed its growth from a magazine primarily for the youth to the voice of the whole church one of widtsoe s employees while at the improvement era was hugh nibley who he convinced to become a professor at brigham young university widtsoe was also part of the genealogy committee of the church being one of the main people behind the implementation of the temple index bureau in 1923 widtsoe accompanied reed smoot on a journey to great britain and the scandinavian countries during which they secured recognition and opened the way for missionaries of the church to return to these lands from 1926 until 1932 he served as president of the european mission while in this office widtsoe convinced the first presidency to call a separate president of the british mission so that the european mission president could assume his duties as the supervisor of all the missions in europe while president of the european mission widtsoe dedicated czechoslovakia for the preaching of the gospel and worked closely with arthur gaeth in starting the mission there widtsoe married leah dunford a daughter of susa young gates who was a daughter of brigham young widtsoe worked closely with his wife and motherinlaw in their writing of a biography of brigham young it is this relationship that caused widtsoe to complete a book on the teachings of brigham young john and leah also wrote a book entitled the word of wisdom a modern interpretation this book advocates eating healthy food as part of the word of wisdom although not as a required portion that should be lived in order to get a temple recommend besides the teachings of brigham young widtsoe was also the lead compiler of gospel doctrine selections from the sermons and writings of joseph f smith sixth president of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints widtsoe also wrote a rational theology as taught by the church of jesus christ of latterday saints which has been cited by later lds authors such as j reuben clark another book of widtsoe s was evidences and reconciliations which was actually a compilation of his improvement era writings which were his answers to the questions on matters of faith he received most often in this work widtsoe admits that there are multiple interpretations that latterday saints can hold on issues one example is his explanation of the creation of the earth he points out that faithful latterday saints hold the sixday sixthousand years and undefinedperiod interpretations of the creation although he gives by far the most space to the explanation of the unknownperiod interpretation he does not rigidly contest for any of these interpretations widtsoe also wrote priesthood and church welfare and priesthood and church government both published in 1939 his work the message of the doctrine and covenants was published after his death after having been edited by his soninlaw g homer durham widtsoe wrote seven claims of the book of mormon a collection of evidences with franklin s harris jr widtsoe wrote joseph smith seeker after truth prophet of god it was published in 1951 and later reprinted by bookcraft in 1957 it begins with an account of the first vision and goes all the way to joseph smith s martyrdom at carthage another work by widtsoe on joseph smith was joseph smith as a scientist a contribution to mormon philosophy published by the young men s mutual improvement association in 1908 in 1944 his essay the divine mission of joseph smith was included in handbook of the restoration published by zion s printing and publishing company in independence missouri widtsoe wrote two autobiographies the first in the gospel net largely focused on his mother s conversion to the church the second in a sunlit land told the story of his later life and also included explanations of his educational philosophy another book by widtsoe was dryfarming a system of agriculture for countries under a low rainfall new york macmillan company 1920  he also served as a coauthor of dodge s geography of utah he wrote numerous works including a hymn how long lord most holy and true which appears as hymn 126 in the current lds hymnal widtsoe died in salt lake city utah of uremia he also had prostate cancer for a number of years before his death adam s bennion was called to the quorum of the twelve after widtsoe s death  john edward brownlee served as attorneygeneral of alberta from 1921 until 1926 in the united farmers of alberta ufa government of herbert greenfield as brownlee was the only lawyer in a caucus formed almost entirely of farmers his role extended beyond the traditional expectations of an attorneygeneral and ranged from providing legal advice to explaining how to write a business letter he also became the government s de facto leader in the legislative assembly of alberta ufa members held widely disparate political views and brownlee quickly became identified with the government s conservative faction he opposed radical changes to the structure of government and urged thrift in public spending as part of the government s attempts to balance its budget brownlee favoured selling its moneylosing railways and concluding an agreement with the federal government to give alberta control over its natural resources he was unsuccessful at both as a member of a farmers government he was also involved in attempts to alleviate droughtinduced poverty in southern alberta and in investigations into the establishment of a provincial wheat pool ufa members of the legislative assembly mlas began to see brownlee as a better leader than the indecisive greenfield a group of them attempted to force greenfield to resign in brownlee s favour though brownlee opposed these attempts initially threatening to resign if greenfield did he was eventually persuaded to accept the premiership if greenfield willingly relinquished it brownlee became premier november 23 1925 brownlee began his legal career in calgary and the ufa was one of his firm s major clients one of the projects he undertook for it was the creation of the united grain growers ugg  of whose securities division he became general manager in 1919 he also travelled around alberta with ufa president henry wise wood answering ufa members legal questions while wood spoke to them about politics and the farmers movement though brownlee was not initially interested in the ufa s political activities this changed through his association with wood and progressive party of canada leader thomas crerar until 1919 the ufa s political activities were limited to advocacy but that year it decided to run candidates in the 1921 provincial election despite brownlee s burgeoning interest in politics he did not view himself as part of the ufa s political branch and did not run as a candidate indeed he was on vacation in victoria british columbia for most of the campaign the ufa contested the election without a leader so when it won 38 of the 61 seats in the legislative assembly of alberta it did not know who it would recommend to form a government as premier of alberta wood was not interested and suggested that brownlee should take the position to the latter s astonishment brownlee did not believe that as an urbanite and lawyer he would be acceptable to the rural ufa caucus and declined the position went to herbert greenfield though the ufa mlas were not willing to accept a nonfarmer as premier many of them realized that the post of attorneygeneral should go to a lawyer others were less convinced and brownlee was invited to address the ufa caucus he acknowledged that there was no constitutional requirement on the question but advised that a nonlawyer attorneygeneral would be wholly reliant on the advice of the lawyers on his staff with the caucus convinced greenfield asked brownlee to accept the position brownlee demurred reluctant to take the resulting cut in income not eager to leave his family in calgary to work in edmonton the provincial capital  and leery of the high expectations invested in the new government by the province s farmers ultimately a combination of duty loyalty and ambition convinced him to accept the position though the choice of cabinet ministers is traditionally the prerogative of the premier as part of the ufa s agenda of democratic reform greenfield agreed to present his choices to the caucus for vetting brownlee was approved august 11 1921 and was sworn in two days later neither he nor greenfield had run as a candidate in the election and neither was a member of the legislature percival baker the ufa member elected for ponoka had died on election day opening up a seat for one of them a second seat peace river became available when incumbent donald macbeth kennedy resigned to run in the 1921 federal election greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern riding than the urban lawyer brownlee and so brownlee was acclaimed as ponoka s mla december 9 1921 was the only lawyer in a government composed primarily of farmers and the rest of the cabinet drew heavily on his expertise its reliance on him extended beyond legal issues to such matters as how to write a business letter greenfield was among the most dependent and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorneygeneral for a draft response greenfield often signed the draft and send it out unchanged the premier eventually relied on brownlee so heavily that brownlee set the agenda for cabinet meetings the government also relied on brownlee in the legislature where it found itself under relentless attack from the john r boyleled liberals brownlee had the widest debating experience of the ufa members and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks his maiden speech was typical of him i came into this house with considerable trepidation because i knew that sitting opposite would be the former giants of this house men with ability experience and skill since coming in i ve listened to all these mengiving their bestand now i blush at my own modesty when greenfield was asked a difficult question in the legislature he often leaned over to brownlee his seatmate who supplied him with an answer in full view of the legislature many ufa members found this practice humiliating brownlee s importance to the government in the legislature was illustrated by an incident in 1922 brownlee was on vacation in victoria during a special sitting of the legislature while his presence was usually considered crucial the only item of business scheduled for the session was uncontroversial and passed by a large margin however once this item was dispensed with some members complained that the c100 payment that they were to receive for the special session was too low greenfield brought a motion to double it the amount was increased to 250 in committee at a time when many farmers earned less than 250 per year the move cost the ufa dearly in the eyes of its supporters many ufa mlas privately suggested that the incident would have been avoided had brownlee been present on another occasion in 1924 brownlee was absent from the legislature due to illness boyle called him to assure him that he could rest easy since the liberals would not raise any difficult issues in his absence while brownlee appreciated the gesture all involved recognized it as an admission that the government was helpless in the legislature without its strongman brownlee s work as an mla extended beyond the legislature he gave close attention to correspondence from his constituents especially those alleging improper treatment at ponoka s psychiatric hospital he prepared thoroughly for speaking engagements in his riding trying to anticipate all possible questions these measures were reflected in his support in the largely rural riding where the calgary lawyer became a popular and wellrespected mla many of the elected ufa members espoused radical political doctrines calculated to transform the provincial government brownlee quickly became identified with the caucus s conservative faction at the caucus meeting that approved his appointment he put an end to discussion of whether nominations for justices of the peace should come from ufa locals or its central political committee by asserting that they would continue to be handled by the office of the attorneygeneral later many ufa mlas argued that only motions explicitly declaring a lack of confidence in the government should be treated as motions of nonconfidence they were concerned that supporters of the government who nonetheless disagreed with it on a specific issue might be pressured to refrain from voting their consciences on motions such as money bills that were conventionally considered tests of the government s confidence brownlee warned these mlas that regardless of their beliefs the lieutenantgovernor of alberta was free to request the government s resignation any time he considered that it lacked or did not merit the legislature s confidence despite this warning ufa mlas john russell love and alex moore proposed a resolution in the legislature changing the convention the proposal attracted notice from across canada r b bennett advised brownlee his former clerk to warn moore and love that it was unconstitutional and demand that they withdraw it brownlee was reluctant to do so since a similar proposal had been part of the ufa s election platform and instead moved successful amendments weakening the motion to a vague statement of intent brownlee clashed again with the ufa s radical elements on the question of a provincial bank the writings of c h douglas advocating an economic system that he called social credit were attracting notice in alberta and his adherents included many ufa members led by george bevington they sponsored a resolution at the ufa convention in january 1923 calling for the creation of a governmentowned bank after bevington s introduction support for the resolution was running high brownlee cooled enthusiasm with a speech of his own warning delegates that alberta s debt load could not manage the programs that bevington proposed that a provincial bank should undertake even so the convention passed a resolution calling on the provincial government to apply for a bank charter from the federal government which was responsible for banking under the british north america act 1867 at brownlee s recommendation the greenfield government struck a commission under the leadership of university of alberta economist d a macgibbon which strongly recommended against the establishment of a provincial bank this mirrored brownlee s own conclusion reached after investigating staterun banks in new zealand and new south wales at the 1924 ufa convention bevington and his followers reaffirmed their demands brownlee responded by pointing to the findings of the macgibbon commission and to his contention that the proposal was unconstitutional and would bankrupt the province in this he was supported by henry wise wood whom bevington was challenging for the ufa presidency brownlee proposed instead that the government s treasury branches should begin to accept deposits brownlee also advocated a conservative approach on budgetary issues the ufa government inherited a large budget deficit and brownlee was dissatisfied with greenfield s early efforts at reducing it in 1922 he warned the premier that unless the government sharply cut expenditures he would find it difficult to defend its fiscal policy in that year s session of the legislature in 1924 unsatisfied with greenfield s response he made an example of his own department cutting staff and taking a strict approach to spending in 1923 he found an ally for his position in new provincial treasurer richard gavin reid who impressed on his cabinet colleagues the need for thrift and recommended the creation of a purchasing department for coordinating government expenditures the province s poor financial situation was due in part to its 5 million annual expenditure on railways comprising 37 percent of the 1922 budget these expenditures resulted from the collapse of four smallrailroad syndicates which left the government to finance the rail construction brownlee believed that these lines the largest of which was the edmonton dunvegan and british columbia edbc line should be sold to either the canadian national railway or the canadian pacific railway though neither was interested in purchasing the lines in 1925 both expressed an interest in leasing the edbc however the royal bank of canada which held the mortgage on the edbc refused to consent to any lease arrangement unless the alberta government redeemed its stock in the railway as security for the mortgage brownlee was inclined to agree with minister of railways vernor smith that the government should buy the mortgage from the royal bank and become the owner and operator of the line but greenfield was resistant to this approach and resolution of the railways question had to wait until brownlee was premier brownlee was also active on natural resource issues alberta along with saskatchewan and manitoba had been admitted into confederation without being granted the control over its natural resources that the older provinces enjoyed over theirs while the federal government did provide a compensatory grant in lieu of resource rights alberta sought control over the resources not only because it believed that this would yield higher revenues than the grant but out of sheer pride in 1920 prime minister arthur meighen committed the federal government in principle to transferring resource rights all that remained to discuss were the terms alberta while willing to forgo the annual subsidy wanted compensation for some of the land and resources previously awarded by the federal government to private interests including of land granted to eastern railway companies mineral leases that deprived the government of royalties for more than half of the of coal extracted from alberta annually and assorted areas with hydroelectric potential that had been yielded to private companies became the province s chief negotiator on resource questions in october 1921 though early attempts at reaching agreement were hampered by the unwillingness of the maritime provinces to agree to the necessary constitutional amendments unless their own annual subsidies were increased negotiations between the provincial and federal government continued intermittently throughout the 1920s liberal prime minister william lyon mackenzie king occasionally appeared receptive to alberta s demands but never fully agreed to them a possible explanation for this is found in a 1924 letter from alberta liberal party leader john r boyle to king explaining that the ufa was likely to lose the next provincial election to boyle s liberals unless something extraordinary happens that extraordinary thing which greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you the natural resources at once o despite this letter the sides seemed close to agreement in early 1925 at a january conference alberta accepted in principle a federal offer of three years of continuing subsidy after the transfer of resource rights after an exhaustive series of meetings between brownlee and the federal counsel the agreement went back to the governments for approval as greenfield and brownlee expressed their impatience with federal inaction an intergovernmental meeting was convened in may the meeting proceeded at a leisurely pace into june after which king announced that his cabinet would like the summer to consider the agreement in greater detail the albertans returned home in disgust the consequences of continued control of alberta s resources by the federal government extended beyond the merely financial as alberta s smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the electrical grid calgary power made an application to the federal government for hydroelectric rights on the upper bow river not wanting these rights to fall into private hands brownlee made an application of his own on behalf of the alberta government it was denied by charles stewart federal minister of the interior and the premier of alberta whom the ufa had defeated in 1921 in 1924 the ufa government passed the mineral tax act which taxed mineral rightsholders at a rate of three cents per acre the two largest such rightsholders the canadian pacific railway and the hudson s bay company urged the federal government to use its power of disallowance to put a stop to the legislation when the federal government complied brownlee protested its action on three grounds first as a direct tax the proposed levy was within alberta s rights under section 92 of the british north america act 1867 and it was constitutional convention for the federal government to exercise disallowance only when the impugned legislation was clearly unconstitutional second disallowance allowed the province no recourse to the courts where the constitutionality of the legislation could be tested third the federal government s stated reasons for disallowing the legislation which were released belatedly by justice minister ernest lapointe were according to brownlee erroneous and led brownlee to suggest that lapointe a quã©bã©cois lawyer trained in the civil law tradition of his home province rather than the common law system used in the rest of canada must be unfamiliar with the landholding system outside of quebec brownlee s attacks were rejected and the disallowance stood the ufa took office at a time of drought in the southern regions of the province at brownlee s instigation the government appointed a threeperson panel led by charles alexander magrath to investigate the problem in 1922 the government passed the drought relief act the act a brownlee brainchild created a drought relief commissioner to whom farmers in affected areas could turn for financial counselling and asset administration it authorized the adjustment of farmers debts to levels that were within the debtors means but still sufficiently acceptable to creditors that their willingness to make loans would not disappear altogether brownlee hoped that this system would provide affected farmers with sound financial advice and facilitate the fair division of farmers assets among competing creditors without forcing farmers to pay high legal fees in 1923 this was replaced by the debt adjustment act which strengthened the commissioner s powers and was intended to extend his jurisdiction over the entire province due to opposition from lenders the portions of the act dealing with other than droughtstricken areas were never proclaimed name change of the legislation reflected brownlee s growing belief that farmers financial troubles were due to factors more systemic than lack of rain angry over the federal government s decision to allow the first incarnation of the canadian wheat board cwb to lapse many albertan farmers began to advocate the pooling of their wheat which would render individual farmers less susceptible to the machinations of grain speculators by introducing collective marketing with each farmer receiving an averaged identical price farmers in saskatchewan and manitoba were more adamant about the return of the cwb prime minister king eventually agreed to its recreation provided that at least two of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba passed enabling legislation and found the personnel necessary to sit on the board by june 1923 the provinces had not found anybody suitable interest in pooling experienced a resurgence in july a ufa meeting which brownlee attended as the government s representative endorsed the creation of a wheat pool as soon as practicable brownlee and his cabinet colleague richard gavin reid undertook an investigation of how soon this might be which included a trip to san francisco to meet with aaron sapiro an american agricultural cooperative leader sapiro proclaimed that a wheat pool could be organized in a few weeks though both brownlee and reid disagreed and returned to canada committed to caution however in their absence the edmonton journal and calgary herald had invited sapiro to tour alberta and his speeches stirred up extravagant expectations among ufa members for immediate action in time for the new organization to market the 1923 crop faced with the zeal of its membership the ufa leadership appointed a 17person committee including brownlee to create the alberta cooperative wheat producers limited the membership fee was to be three dollars and the organization was to work with similar organizations in saskatchewan and manitoba the provincial governmentat brownlee s insistenceand the ugg both provided startup loans the ugg also took the lead in agreeing to let its grain elevators be used by the pool which allowed brownlee to defeat those committee members who thought the new company should acquire its own elevators by the end of august it was obvious that the organizations in saskatchewan and manitoba were not going to be ready in time for the 1923 crop and the committee decided to proceed alone it determined that if farmers representing half of alberta s total wheat acreage agreed to pool their crop by september 15 the pool would proceed brownlee believed that this was an impossible objective despite the experimental and unproven nature of the model and the asyet nonexistent organization that was to execute it this objective was met the alberta wheat pool was born by the following year s harvest comparable organizations had formed in saskatchewan and manitoba and a central selling agency csa was formed to sell all three provinces wheat the csa s first president alexander james mcphail whom brownlee helped select  offered brownlee the position of csa general manager at the attractive salary of 20000 per year a figure that brownlee had helped set  at the urging of his government colleagues and the ufa leadership both of who felt his continued presence in edmonton was vital to the ufa government s hold on power he declined he was instead made the csa s general counsel brownlee was also heavily involved in the creation of a livestock pool and three dairy pools as a sort of poolmania hit alberta farmers as attorneygeneral brownlee inherited the prohibition implemented by the previous liberal government while the ufa base and public opinion both favoured prohibition the existing law was full of loopholes and unevenly enforced some judges opponents of prohibition refused to convict defendants charged with liquor offences the ufa had pledged during the election campaign to introduce prohibition in fact as well as in law and the task fell to brownlee he initially cooled expectations by announcing that he had no interest in making imwelvc any hasty or illconsidered move either in changing the law or altering enforcement the existing one september 21 1922 constable steve lawson of the alberta provincial police was murdered at his blairmore home by bootlegger emil picariello and his companion florence lassandra he was the third policeman killed in alberta in liquorrelated incidents in 1922 the murder opened up a rift between albertans of british descent who saw bootlegging as an affront to the rule of law even if they did not support prohibition and albertans of southern and eastern european descent who found prohibition to be something of a joke and accepted bootlegging brownlee authorized the deployment of special constables to apprehend picariello and lassandra once they were arrested he appeared personally at the prosecution s bench alongside a a mcgillivray reputedly alberta s best courtroom lawyer whose services he secured specifically for the case picariello and lassandra were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging by the time of their executions in may 1923 public opinion was turning against prohibition the sentiment that criminal activities such as picariello s were the inevitable result of prohibition laws became a popular one as did the view that the government should legalize and regulate liquor sales brownlee morally supportive of prohibition began to personally support this course believing that prohibition was unenforceable in the face of widespread public opposition a 1923 referendum opted for the end of prohibition in 1924 brownlee guided the government liquor control actdrafted with the assistance of r b bennett who received 1000 for his servicesthrough the legislature as attorneygeneral brownlee was responsible for administration of the lord s day act which forbade most commerce on sundays charles huestis of the lord s day alliance took issue with the edmonton orchestra s sunday concerts on the grounds that by opening them only to its subscription holders it was de facto charging admission and that by paying its musicians honoraria it was gainfully employing them in their regular professions on sundays brownlee declined to prosecute since courts had previously held that the concerts were legal huestis retorted that as attorneygeneral brownlee should make them illegal to which brownlee responded that he fully appreciated the importance of the sabbath and did not need to be lectured on the subject by huestis there were also complaints about farmers violating the act by working sundays brownlee felt that such complaints were often more about conflicts between neighbours than preservation of the sabbath and prosecuted only the most gratuitous and flagrant cases in the 1921 federal election 65 of the canadian house of commons 235 seats were won by progressives and allied factions including the ufa which won both seats it contested liberal prime ministerdesignate william lyon mackenzie king had only a minority and expected to rely on the support of these progressives to govern progressive leader thomas crerar envisioned forming a coalition government with the liberals and knew that he would be expected to provide cabinet members from alberta which had been swept by progressives and allied parties seeing no cabinet material among the elected members he sent an emissary to edmonton to convince greenfield or brownlee to enter federal politics brownlee refused and advised greenfield to do the same on the grounds that their abandonment of provincial politics soon after the ufa s election would be seen as a betrayal as greenfield s shortcomings became obvious brownlee found himself fielding propositions closer to home in 1924 a group of ufa mlas dissatisfied with greenfieldincluding george johnston george maclachlan william shield donald cameron oran mcpherson and austin claypoolapproached brownlee to advise him that they planned to ask the premier to resign in favour of his attorneygeneral to their surprise brownlee immediately told them that if greenfield resigned so would he faced with brownlee s refusal to cooperate with their coup the dissidents relented they made another attempt in 1925 brownlee again threatened to resign but this time was persuaded by henry wise wood to accept the crown if greenfield relinquished it willingly greenfield assured brownlee that he had not wanted the job of premier in the first place and would happily see brownlee take it from him faced with these assurances brownlee agreed to form a government and became premier of alberta november 23 1925 he remained attorneygeneral until after the 1926 election when he appointed the newlyelected john lymburn to replace him  karsa orlong is a fictional character in steven erikson s fantasy series malazan book of the fallen he makes his first appearance in the novel deadhouse gates as toblakai bodyguard to shaik his past is revealed in the subsequent novel house of chains karsa orlong is a teblor warrior of the uryd tribe his grandfather pahlk orlong was a famed warrior who had centuries before gone into the lowlands from the laederon plateau and slew many children as the teblor call lowlanders karsa grew up on these stories and believed that was how a true teblor warrior was to behave karsa s father synyg did not approve of this mindset for he knew pahlk s exploits to be lies and twistings of the truth however no one else knew this and so karsa organized a raid in honor of both his grandfather and his god urugal the woven as warleader of his group he and his comrades bairoth gild and delum thord raided through sunyd and rathyd lands to finally arrive at the same place where pahlk had his escapades along the way his group encountered and freed the forkrul assail known as calm calm attacked karsa seeing the influence of the teblor gods on him but karsa was barely injured as delum thord defended him and received severe brain damage in the attempt becoming reduced to a childlike state upon reaching the lowlands karsa and his party found a small fortified town instead of the farm his grandfather had raided during the attack on this town delum thord was killed and bairoth gild and karsa were both captured bairoth was slain and karsa was soon after sold into slavery and lost his faith in his gods after weeks of being chained to a wagon bed for transport to the sea karsa and his companion torvald nom found freedom in the fragment of kurald emurlahn known as the nascent during their time in this realm karsa and torvald boarded the silanda and slew the tiste edur on board they met up with other survivors from the slaving ship that had been wrecked in the nascent and returned to the normal world with them arriving just off the shore of seven cities near ehrlitan karsa and torvald nom left the slavers behind on the shore and encountered the supposedlydead napan urko who called himself keeper and dabbled in archaeology they left for ehrlitan and were soon reenslaved by the very same slaver silgar the group was captured by malazan forces after arrival in ehrlitan silgar claiming karsa as a slave he had recaptured both silgar and karsa were imprisoned and karsa wound up with a tattoo on his face marking him as an escaped slave karsa and his cellmate later escaped and fled into the panpotsun odhan whereupon karsa was told of his true racial identity as a thelomen toblakai from whom the teblor people were descended karsa known from this point on as toblakai goes with his cellmate leoman of the flails into the holy desert raraku and becomes the loyal bodguard to shaik eventually karsa orlong leaves the holy desert raraku having been persuaded to go in search of a jhag horse he proceeds west into the jhag odhan this move was also one his false gods desired along his journey he encounters and fights icarium the jhag known as the slayer of the ten thousand and karsa s ironwood sword is destroyed neither icarium nor karsa is slain as both are knocked unconscious in the clash shortly thereafter karsa orlong finally meets his gods in the jhag odhan who prove to be tlan imass who were shattered in battle millennia earlier they reveal to him that he was not just their pawn in their plans to regain physical form but karsa had also been made the knight of chains in a tellanninfused sacred cavern the seven unbound tlan imass help karsa orlong create an unbreakable sword of stone into which the souls of delum thord and bairoth gild go infusing it with bloodthirst karsa now rearmed and faced with manifestations he could attack shrugged off the facade of doing as the unbound told him and drove six of them off further destroying the seventh siballe the unfound on his way out he encounters the tiste edur warrior trull sengar and his tlan imass companion onrack karsa was not in a mood to kill them and so the pair luckily survived a short time later karsa meets a jaghut and his sister who help karsa obtain the jhag horse he had set out to collect in the first place karsa then turns around and rides back into the holy desert upon arriving back in the oasis at the time of the final battle in which the army of the apocalypse was crushed karsa proceeded to kill several members of the camp with whom he had issues though he could not find all of his targets while scouring the camp karsa encounters two of the hounds of darkness known as deragoth who had returned to life and butchers them with frightening ease tying the hounds heads to his horse karsa speeds off into the desert at dawn telling the malazan forces they are no longer his sworn enemy at this time karsa vows to return home and claim the army the unbound tlan imass had set aside for him using this force to raise his people from the level to which they had sunk karsa then on his way back to his people encounters a human woman the witch samar dev in the desert who happens to be dying of thirst he helps her and notes in passing that the reason that she is dying is because the selfpowered carriage she built broke down he travels with her to her village where people are immediately suspicious of him samar dev persuades them to leave him alone learning of a castle into which people have disappeared karsa decides to find out what s inside here he finds a kchain chemalle nahruk and kills it after a ferocious fight however the village inhabitants remain suspicious of him and karsa decides to leave with samar dev after a long journey they meet a tiste edur fleet on a mission to collect champions for their emperor rhulad sengar who is the king in chains the toblakai decides to go quietly for two reasons to prove his might against the seemingly unkillable emperor and also because he discovers that icarium lifestealer is to challenge the emperor as well arriving in lether the continent which the edur have conquered  karsa proves himself the strongest champion by beating all other challengers except icarium who does nt duel though he meets the jhag in the city he does nt fight him because he discovers that icarium has toblakai blood in his veins finally karsa meets rhulad sengar and manages to create a blood ritual that creates a portal that brings him into the crippled god s realm there he kills the edur s spirit and refuses to take the cursed sword that made rhulad immortal he then leaves the realm thanks to a portal of fire that had suddenly appeared in toll the hounds we learn that the portal has brought him to genabackis where he meets again with samar dev together with the man known as traveler with whom he starts a friendship travelling together they arrive in darujhistan where karsa witnesses the clash between anomander rake and traveller who is in truth dassem ultor which ends with the former s death despite being deeply humbled by the duel the toblakai once again proves his might by stopping the newly awakened hounds of light from taking rake s sword dragnipur helped by the knight of death and lastly by the daughters he bore by the rape of a mother and her daughter that he committed when setting out on his original quest at the end of toll the hounds karsa decides to stay in the city also because the former bridgeburner picker has sent him a message from hood telling him that he is needed to help kill a god  kfac was a commercial classical music radio station in los angeles broadcasting for most of its life on 1330 khz am and subsequently in both simulcast and separate programming on 923 mhz fm as well only 41 of nearly 9000 commercial radio stations in the united states play classical music and kfac was considered one of the best on september 20 1989 at 2 pm new owners changed both its name and its format depriving southern california of a major cultural institution during its heyday the station was arguably the most important cultural organization in the los angeles area having greater influence on lovers of classical music than even the los angeles philharmonic announcers such as howard rhines dick crawford thomas cassidy carl princi fred crane steve allen alfred leonard tom dixon bill carlson dick joy tom franklin ed stoddard bernie alan rodger layng steve markham and doug ordunio were featured on the station for several years the station also carried the daily syndicated adventures in good music with karl haas other regularly scheduled programs were hosted by leonora schildkraut werner klemperer and gussie moran many of its programs such as the gas company evening concert luncheon at the music center and the world of opera lasted for decades with the gas company show airing for over 40 years the station s djs also had unusual career longevity according to some estimates their collective tenure at the station was over 400 years this unique staying power and the fact that at times kfac was the only classical musical station in los angeles kusc its last competitor did not convert to full time classical music broadcasting until 1976 and despite being noncommercial never achieved the listenership of the professionally formatted kfac meant that several generations of angelenos grew up listening to the station that along with its cultural authority gave the station a special place in their affections like most radio stations in the 1940s kfac did not fill one niche but rather broadcast a wide variety of programming including baseball games from the pacific coast league its evolution into the all classicalmusic format was a slow process over many years its first classical music show began in december 1943 when thomas cassidy began hosting a twohour nightly program sponsored by the southern california gas company eventually the station added a second show musical masterpieces it was cassidy s responsibility to build the musical library for these shows in 1945 the station s owner el cord the fac in the station s call letters stood for fuller auburn cord the auburn cord duesenberg dealer in the los angeles area and western region headquarters for the auburn automobile co the transmitter was located on the roof of the building  was touring the station when he saw for the first time the huge collection of discs a full symphony might take up twelve 78 rpm discs kfac owned cord decided to make better use of this investment by switching to allclassical music management tested the waters on this idea by asking the audience if they wanted another nighttime program lucky lager dance time which played pop and swing tunes to continue or if they would prefer more classical classical won by a slim margin tom dixon hosted the afternoon shift his frequent errors from mispronouncing the names of conductors and performers to playing movements of concertos and symphonies in the wrong order  prompted listener sarah lee halpern to write to dixon suggesting he name his show music and mistakes with tom dixon o for a long time afterwards every time dixon made an error he would say i m sorry sarah lee â€¦ dixon s lessformal atmosphere and willingness to admit his errors on the air endeared him to audiences  another listener once asked dixon who writes your mistakes  for years dixon signed off with the phrase ttfn ta ta for now  dick crawford on the weekends was famous for playing opera records out of order and once played bach s brandenburg concerto at the wrong speed from 1952 1973 kfac broadcast performances from the hollywood bowl the station pioneered an early form of stereo broadcast by having two microphones on different sides of the bowl listeners at home who had two radios were instructed to place them seven to twelve feet apart and tune one to the 923 fm band and the other to kfac s am frequency 1330 this method of producing stereo came to an end with the advent of fm multiplexing bowl broadcasts featured an intermission program and interview hosted by thomas cassidy on nonbroadcast nights cassidy appeared onstage at intermission to welcome the audience to the venue ultimately he was christened the voice of the hollywood bowl o however ernest fleishmann who had been hired as executive director of the los angeles philharmonic upon assuming management of the hollywood bowl terminated cassidy s appearances from 1953 to 1986 carl princi hosted the world of opera o heard weekdays at 3 pm this hourlong program played selections from a wide variety of operas both famous and obscure another wellknown program was continental varieties which played every weekday afternoon at 3 pm with distinctive theme music by the english light music composer eric coates the los angeles music center a threetheatre complex opened in 1964 luncheon at the music center was created in the early 1960s by thomas cassidy who also hosted the program for its first eleven years the progam was considered by many the preeminent talk show on which to plug theatrical and musical events in the southern california area broadcast weekdays live from the then pavilion restaurant of the dorothy chandler pavilion of the music center with recorded shows only on holidays  the show interviewed not only musicians but also actors and directors who were either involved in local productions or just visiting the area the guests actually did eat lunch during the show during musical interludes though the host did not nonetheless the presence of other diners at the restaurant gave the show one of its hallmark elements the sounds of plates and cutlery clacking in the background originally the program was broadcast using one microphone in the middle of the table eventually that was increased to three which decreased the need for everyone talking to lean so far forward martin workman succeeded thomas cassidy and hosted the show for 14 years during the latter years of the station kfac made various attempts to appeal to a younger audience most of these attempts were brought about by some of the youngest staff members dennis parnell and doug ordunio one of the most unusual programs of all was the institution of global village which was heard from 1974 until 1986 it was conceived by then fm programmer dennis parnell who was also a professional singer and voice teacher in the los angeles area the basic idea of the show was to extend the concept of style so that all types of music would be considered appropriate one of the most unusual juxtapositions attempted by parnell during these early stages was to combine an obscure wordless choral composition by sergei rachmaninoff with janis joplin s recording of the song mercedes benz this was considered rather shocking to some of the station s dyedinthewool listeners however it did serve to attract a number of younger listeners as well as older listeners with open minds who were interested in hearing new ideas the station had often been criticized as a dinosaur and the announcing style was viewed as stodgy its opening tagline spoken each week by host carl princi was welcome to global village a meeting place for the i and the ear after several months on the air parnell decided that he should receive additional monies in order to continue the production of the show since the show was rather timeconsuming to prepare he proceeded to tell program director carl princi that he would stop production of the show if his demands were not met princi then had a meeting with then library employee doug ordunio princi asked ordunio if it would be possible for him to continue production of global village if parnell made good on his threat to end the program he agreed to continue since he also possessed a vast musical knowledge regardless of style this move effectively ended the friendship between parnell and ordunio parnell left the station around april 1974 ordunio was installed as the new fm programmer a job he continued until dec 31 1986 under ordunio s direction global village ascended to greater heights and created more unusual sounds and experiments of music such as the night a slow movement from a mahler symphony and a bruckner symphony were heard simultaneously ordunio was responsible for creating other provocative classical music programs such as at home with which featured interviews recorded at the homes of classical musical celebrities who lived in southern california he also produced five 4hour specials collectively known as the circular path which expounded the idea that all music was bounded by a series of concepts and forms which would eventually repeat themselves the program began with the sound of the aortic pulse recorded within a mother s uterus the first sound ostensibly heard by a fetus  and then took listeners through the history of music with compositions as well as interviews with prominent musical figures the final show was four hours of conjectures about the future of classical music the most unusual idea set forth was stated by composer henry brant who said that we would someday find ourselves in a world of music pollution the entire program ended with a live recording of singer peter allen performing everything old is new again which was basically the philosophy behind the entire 20hour program the last show created by ordunio before the station s decline was making waves a program of new age music airing during a period before the creation of such stations as the wave at the time the program was instituted on friday nights at 11 00 pm the only broadcast vehicle for this music was a show known as midnight cafã© on knxfm this program and global village were abandoned by robert goldfarb program director under louise heifetz because they were deemed inappropriate for the station s image these recollections are by former announcer doug ordunio one of the funniest moments on luncheon at the music center occurred during the tenure of host thomas cassidy since the program was run live and without tape delay the guests needed to be on their best behavior cassidy was a strict roman catholic one day when composer conductor lukas foss was a guest on the show he suddenly spouted out this uncensored remark there is always that wonderful story told about beethoven who wrote a letter to a music critic saying what i shit is better than what you write  cassidy was stuck because nothing could prevent the offending word from being broadcast after martin workman took over the program another wonderful occasion was his interview of the guests who were in the current la production of a chorus line for music workman needed to play the original broadway cast recording however he did nt audition the recording for lyrical content and so all the songs with bad lyrics from the t and a song on down went right over the air much to the consternation of workman thomas cassidy was like a ghost one never saw him in the halls of the station he would arrive in the middle of the night record and leave the lps for the next week s shows and disappear back to the sf valley he always prided himself on his consistent professional deportment on the air one night i decided to tune in the gas company program as i was driving in my car the familiar tchaikovsky theme was heard cassidy usually said good evening friends this is thomas cassidy â€¦ however this time we heard good evening friends â€¦ what the hell s going on here then i heard the volume turned down on the voice track when the engineer susan rouzer deemed it was ok to proceed she warily turned the track back up cassidy s final word before the first front announcement were you get a lot more than gas from the gas company i immediately pulled over and phoned the station telling susan do nt let that voice track out of your sight that is a keeper put it on my desk after the show tom franklin  called the dean of southern california business news reporters who hosted executive report on kfac amfm for many years was the best man for the job he was often gone on sponsored press junkets around the world and he spoke with many top people at corporations everywhere his show was the source of many intentional as well as unintentional bits of humor he was also a notorious tippler and it was noted that he was probably one of the few people who fell down the stairs in the posh wilshire blvd restaurant perino s without spilling a drop of his gin and tonic his reputation was shared with doug ordunio and engineer richard nielsen who worked the morning shift  for several years the trio kept a collection of all the empty liquor bottles whose contents they had consumed on the station premises these were place on top of the record shelves in a location that could not be seen by the general public when they were finally discarded after several years they filled a large trash can one of the funniest intentional moments on the show was when franklin interviewed the owner of the dutch liqueur company known in that country as wyn and fokking tom got the executive to explain the company s transition to the us market and the owners were warned that they needed to change the name due to the similarity of one of its names to an obscene word in english their solution was to change the name to bols which when spoken by the netherlander seemed very similar to the english slang word for testicles  franklin was also known for breaking into laughter on the air so uncontrollably that it would take him minutes to recover this happened quite a number of times so much so that in the master control room a tape was kept which was labeled the tom franklin memorial reel the story he loved to tell was one from his earlier days when in the middle of a longer scripted segment he heard a click on the desktop next to him when he glanced up to see what it was some person had placed a tall drink glass partially filled with water and a handful of alka seltzer tablets a condom had been stretched over the top and as the tablets fizzed away the condom rose to an erect position franklin lost it again â€¦ one of the funniest things in which almost the entire staff participated was a video project that was created as a parting gift to the station manager george fritzinger and his exceptional german secretary regina sears it was a station tour conducted by the longtime kfwb news announcer dan evey who was married to a member of the station s sales department michelle davis  the search which visited all areas of the station was to find the office of salesman courtney thompson which was actually placed far into the recesses of the record library near the offices of music director clyde allen fm programmer doug ordunio and assistant programmer steven de mena all of the staff participated and along the wayward path gave their farewells to george and regina obviously the staff members who had the greatest senses of humor provided some of the funniest moments on the tape perhaps the most audacious segment came near the end when the camera visited the fm studio where doug ordunio was apparently but not actually on the air he was seated behind the mike and before he was about to talk on the air he arranged some mysterious white powder actually powdered sugar on top of a large square mirror and with a straw pretended to snort cocaine after doing this he seemed to open the mike and begin cursing wildly as he announced a piece of music the white powder was covering his nose when this tape was shown at a reunion of the staff given at sportsmen s lodge on ventura blvd this spot provided one of the biggest laughs of the evening the tape concluded with the actual homeless man who often reclined beneath one of the shade trees outside the station with his dog waving and saying his goodbye to george and regina those two left before the notorious firing of new years 1986  actually as salesman courtney thompson left the station after having been let go he said to the library staff who were in their offices watch out there s blood spurting everywhere  one of doug ordunio s favorite tag lines for a station id was kfacfm los angeles the bastion of sanity for southern california cleveland broadcasting purchased kfac from the cord estate and was itself purchased after a successful campaign by atlantic states industries asi  a subsidiary of the mcgavringuild rep company under asi kfac ended its ban on commercial jingles o previous policy had been that all commercials had to be voiced by kfac announcers while music beds usually classical were ok ad agency jingles were anathema asi also instituted the combo operation of broadcast consoles so that kfac announcers finally became radio djs previously engineers had spun the records and announcers had merely announced either live or on tape when time came for federal communications commission fcc license renewal a group of challengers also applied for the license claiming that kfac was not serving the local africanamerican community this seemed a ludicrous charge because the station never discriminated against any group in its choice of featured composers or performers investigations seemed to uncover that the protesting group had challenged other station licenses for the purposes of extorting substantial amounts of money from the station owners it is not known precisely how much money was paid by the owners of kfac to settle a possible lawsuit but typically when a station s license is being contested during the renewal process there is a slim chance of it being sold in 1986 a group of investors headed by louise heifetz daughterinlaw of the violin virtuoso jascha heifetz purchased the station for around 33 million she and her accomplice program director robert goldfarb fired most of the staff announcers in the hope that new talent would attract new listeners the highly respected engineering staff was also laid off in the new years blood bath of 1987 supposedly goldfarb had been hired to do the same for manager wallace smith at kusc a few years before during the next three years the station s ratings declined and it was sold to evergreen media who changed its format and recast it as kkbtfm the beat which eventually moved to 1003 fm  an rb station several years ago ralph guild the top man in charge of the company that owned kfac confided that putting the station up for sale was one of the biggest mistakes he ever made in 1989 the new owners donated both the kfac call sign and the classical record library to university of southern california radio station kusc which assigned the call sign to its santa barbara satellite today the 923 frequency is home to hot 923 old school and rb the kfac call letters at home on the santa barbara translator for kusc for over a decade were replaced when the station chose to have all of its affiliates have call letters ending with sc  kyle reese is the primary character in the first terminator film the posthumous father of john connor and the love of sarah connor he is played by michael biehn in the first terminator films jonathan jackson in the television series and played as a teenager by anton yelchin in terminator salvation  kyle reese sergeant techcom en38416  a soldier in the human resistance from the postapocalyptic future of the terminator where most of humanity had already been wiped out in a deadly nuclear war on august 29th 1997 sparked off by an artificial intelligence known as skynet the sentient computer system launched a genocidal war on the survivors kyle reese was born after the nuclear attacks although in some terminator media such as the sarah connor chronicles he was born before the attacks he was later captured by skynet forces as a child and to survive he was forced to work in one of skynet s concentration camps where others are sent to their deaths his freedom comes when a resistance movement led by john connor freed him and the others from skynet afterwards reese served in the 132nd infantry under justin perry from 2021 to 2027 before transferring to techcom under john connor someone he comes to admire and coincidentally consider his closest friend eventually the resistance rallies enough remaining human forces to launch a successful final assault on skynet s central complex the final assault eventually allows the human resistance to cripple skynet as reese explains in the terminator in 2029 the resistance is able to smash through the last of skynet s defense grids allowing them to enter skynet s main compound and destroy it skynet however has a final unexpected option using experimental time displacement equipment skynet sends one of its most feared machines a t800 series terminator back to preapocalypse los angeles california on may 12 1984 to assassinate the young sarah connor known to have been the mother of resistance leader john connor and thus prevent the birth of connor and the success of his future rebellion realizing what skynet is attempting to do connor sends a soldier to intercept the terminator sergeant kyle reese volunteers once he had gone through the time displacement equipment is destroyed leaving only him and the terminator in 1984 arriving unarmed and not knowing what the terminator looks like in its human disguise reese locates and follows sarah connor shadowing her until the t800 attempts to carry out its mission he rescues her warning her of the impending doom of the human race and of the future significance carried by her and her unborn son though initially hostile towards reese sarah grows to trust and love him as he becomes the only thing between her and the terminator on the run from the terminator reese and sarah have sex in which her son and future leader john connor is conceived having grown up in the future where the machines had all but wiped out the human race reese is both physically and mentally hardened his body is scarred from action against the machines including healed burns as a result of wounds sustained after destroying an enemy as witnessed in a nightmare when he tries to sleep in a deleted scene when he tries to stop sarah from going to cyberdyne systems he sees something he has never seen before what the world looks like before the war in the future he says he thinks of it as a dream the trees and stream the flowers and sarah all beautiful he bursts into tears saying it hurts and he believes he does not belong there and he was not meant to see any of this he then agrees with sarah that they should try to change the future though hard and battle weary reese had a love for sarah connor a woman whom he had never met and only knew through a photo the affection kyle reese felt for sarah was based on the legend that surrounded her and on the image of her from the photograph given to him by john connor reese s life however is cut short when both he and sarah are forced to confront the terminator after a high speed chase where he is wounded by gunfire and thinking that they destroyed the terminator in an explosion of a fuel truck they are again chased by the nowmetal endoskeleton inside an automated factory later revealed to be owned by cyberdyne systems kyle turns on various mechanical equipment as visual cover while the terminator batters its way through the door after sarah accidentally turns on a machine they are discovered by the terminator after reaching the stairs of a footwalk reese tells sarah to run for cover while kyle tries to beat the terminator with a metal pipe the terminator knocks kyle to the deck of the footwalk though dazed reese reaches for his last homemade pipe bomb lights it and wedges it in between the terminator s pelvic strut and torso the terminator is blown apart and reese is killed the terminator though blown in half and missing an arm is not destroyed a wounded sarah is able to find enough courage and resolve to destroy it crushing the machine inside a mechanical press while being taken away by paramedics soon afterward sarah tearfully watches as reese s dead body is zipped up in a body bag and taken away sarah stops at a gas station in the deserts of mexico six months later already well into her pregnancy and is debating to herself whether or not she should ever tell john who his father is eventually she decides that she will reflecting that kyle deserves to be remembered for his sacrifice and contribution although kyle reese died not knowing that he was john connor s father john himself would know just then a young mexican boy takes sarah s picture with a kodamatic camera and gives the developed photo to her it is the same photo connor eventually gives to reese in terminator 2 judgement day michael biehn reprised the role of kyle reese sarah connor under heavy sedation imagines him visiting her in a mental institution unchanged from his appearance in the first film he embraces her and implores her to go to their son s aid reminding her that the future is not set o in this dream scene kyle is aware of the fact that he is john s father despite the fact he did nt know of it in real life this scene was removed for the original theatrical release but restored to the extended editions released in the television show terminator the sarah connor chronicles he is born in 2002 before the events of judgment day in this altered timeline in the episode queen s gambit it is revealed that kyle had an older brother named derek brian austin green who was also a resistance soldier actor jonathan jackson portrayed kyle reese in the episode of the first season dungeons dragons which detailed of the last days of what happened of how he and his brother are separated during a recon mission before he made his trip through time to protect sarah connor and later on the episode of the second season goodbye to all that during derek s recollection of the future war he is also played by skyler gisondo as an eightyear old version of the character in the beginning of the episode of what he beheld o in the final episode of the first season what he beheld derek reese takes a now 16yearsold john connor out for ice cream as it is his birthday as they are watching two boys play baseball the younger boy drops the ball and it rolls over to john john picks it up and hands it to him as he and derek are watching john finds the older boy strangely familiar and when he turns around john sees what is written on the back of his shirt reese john realizes that derek took him to see a fiveyear oldversion of kyle and elevenyearold version of derek before telling john that he figured out that kyle is john s dad as whenever i look at you i see him plus your mom s his type in the episode goodbye to all that during one of derek s recollections of the future war kyle when he was a corporal and a small group of his unit attempted to save forty prisoners included general john connor from skynet s forces however he became trapped and one of the resistance s senior officers martin bedell sacrifices his life to save him and free skynet s prisoners derek mentions to john that kyle might have been traumatized when he watched his best friend die after carrying him to an aid station derek also tells john of his brother s fondness for using powerful incendiary armor piercing rounds against hunterkillers during the brothers period of hiding after judgment day derek killed a deer for food however kyle convinced him that it was unfair for them to eat the animal and reese buried the deer instead in the episode the demon hand it s hinted at by sarah to derek reese that kyle s remains have been cremated and scattered in the grass a mental image of kyle reese appeared to a wounded sarah in the episode the good wound throughout the episode her image of kyle guides her in finding medical treatment for herself along with getting help from derek reese kyle s brother in the season two finale born to run john is led by catherine weaver to an alternate postjudgement day timeline where john connor has never led the resistance due to the displacement from his present there he encounters his father for the first time alongside derek reese and allison young kyle reese is portrayed as a teenager by anton yelchin in terminator salvation the film takes place in 2018 and it revolves around his first meeting with his future son john christian bale  as a teenager kyle was the leader of the los angeles resistance cell even though this only consisted of two people because of this he aspires to join the formal resistance regulars who mark themselves with a red stripe on their left sleeve once he has earned it o it is clear that kyle is immediately drawn to the charismatic figure of john connor due to the fact that he leaves his los angeles base immediately after hearing the latter s resistance broadcast inspired by connor s example he frequently quotes segments of the broadcasts and adapts strategies that connor suggests for taking down terminators he similarly shares a unique bond with marcus wright sam worthington  who helps hone kyle s strategies in closequarterscombat whereas kyle s lectures on what humans are fighting for reminds marcus of his humanity in the film kyle s father had initially survived judgment day but died prior to the events of the movie and kyle is the primary target of skynet due to its awareness that he would eventually travel through time to 1984 and father john connor in the film kyle is already working with and protecting a child named star jadagrace berry when the two later save marcus wright from a t600 attack in the ruins of los angeles after skynet captures him outside of la reese upon escaping later worked with his future son building a bomb to destroy skynet s san francisco command the two also fought one of the first t800 models together during this time connor took reese into the resistance with star granting him the promotion to techcom regular kyle and john have begun developing a friendship as mentioned in the first film evidenced by the way in which kyle s promotion signified by inheriting john s tactical jacket with red stripe comes alongside his joining of john s inner circle at the end of the film it was originally scripted that reese and another soldier named sumner were sent to protect sarah from the terminator but sumner died upon arriving after the time portal fused him into a fire escape the sequels show the time displacement field melting whatever object is in the way  in the original script reese says to dr silberman the terminator had already gone through connor sent two of us to intercept it then zeroed the whole place but sumner did nt make it o sumner would later appear in a sarah connor chronicles episode and make it alive through the time portal with kyle s brother and two other resistance time traveling agents a still shot of kyle reese was used as the basis for a pose held by solid snake on the box art for the msx game metal gear right down to the gear he is wearing arnold schwarzenegger was the original choice to play reese while director james cameron intended to use a thinner more ordinary looking actor as the terminator his first choice being lance henriksen upon meeting schwarzenegger cameron decided to cast him as the terminator instead and henriksen was made a police detective however cameron would revisit this idea when he cast robert patrick as the t1000 in the sequel michael biehn almost did not get the role of reese because at his audition he spoke in a southern accent after having just auditioned for a role in a stage production of cat on a hot tin roof earlier that day and could nt shake the accent and the producers did not want reese to seem regionalized after biehn s agent explained this to the producers he got a second audition and won the part the original scriptment gave reese s age as 21 while a later draft gave his age as 22 in real life biehn was 27 years old at the time that he was cast as reese  loaded known as blood factory in japan is a science fictionthemed topdown shoot em up video game that was developed by gremlin interactive and published by interplay loaded was released in late 1995early 1996 around new year time on both the playstation and sega saturn the game had origins in dc comics and more notably the more adultorientated vertigo comics and there was a small graphic novel based on the game the six playable characters of the game are a combination of villains antiheroes psychopaths perverts mutants and flamboyant murderers they are however the last hope to stop the intergalactic supervillain codenamed fub and save the universe the characters were created and designed with contributions from garth ennis of vertigo comics and greg staples of 2000ad later in the same year the game spawned a sequel using almost entirely the same characters and the same game engine albeit one with mildly improved graphics named reloaded reloaded was released on the playstation and pc at the end of 1996 although it did not enjoy as good sales as its predecessor it did however have an acclaimed soundtrack which included music from pop will eat itself as did the first game and the game discs of both games could be played as audio cds both games were notorious for their macabre sense of humor overthetop violence and extreme gore loaded was developed by gremlin interactive a british software house based in sheffield which had previously had a successful run in developing games loaded and its sequel reloaded would be among the last games developed by gremlin interactive before it was acquired by french giant infogrames for â£24 million and the studio in sheffield closed the game was internationally published by americanbased interplay loaded was an interesting marketing gimmick when released considering that the main character design and graphics were done by a host of comic book illustrators like les spink and greg staples of 2000ad fame  the games publisher interplay collaborated with dc comics batman superman doom patrol to create a small 12page novella illustrated with the game s artwork to promote it and introduce the characters and the game premise the book was published bundled with dc s works at the time and dc signed adultorientated vertigo comics star garth ennis preacher hellblazer hitman judge dredd etc to write it the novella is now considered a collector s item the game is set in the distant future long after mankind has discovered fasterthanlight flight and has since colonized most of the inhabitable worlds across the galaxy fub was once a pretty uncultured and incapable catering officer with questionable sanity in the sector marines often screwing up the field kitchens and dropping jars of plusgrial fnart jiz powder into the cooking pot fub which stands fat ugly boy a name he was never able to escape finally lost his mind on a barren desert front during a relatively minor skirmish of the last 40 years not wanting to let imwevpc the boys imwevpc down and unable to find any meat fub amputated his own legs cooked them and served them up to the soldiers in a hot broth despite it being the best dish he had ever created fub was given an unconditional discharge and asked never to show his face again vowing to get revenge on the worlds of man for his banishment and exile fub replaces his legs with mechanical hydraulicpowered replacements and becomes a feared and egotistical space pirate attracting other fragile minds to his cause he undertakes a dramatic bizarre and insane appearance wearing furry dice smoking havana cigars and tattooing a target on his portly belly the six playable characters have notable differences and derangements but what they have in common is that they are all psychotic mercenaries who have been framed for crimes actually committed by fub and are now serving life sentences on an inhospitable maximum security prison planet the planet raulf fub has even taken on a new secretive identity joining the intergalactic prison system and working his way up the ladder by murdering his superiors and taking their positions and fub is now the warden of raulf fub has done this so that he can pin his crimes as a space pirate on other people usually those who are psychotic anyway so as nobody will notice the player or two of the game s six characters in two player mode must escape raulf chase fub and engage on a bloody odyssey across the strange worlds of the galaxy to exact revenge on fub the supervillain however is merely excited by this seeing it as a challenge and a game and to this end he steals the most advanced machine in existence a machine which can toy with the very fabric of the universe manipulate matter and even open doorways to other dimensions with this machine fub plans to hold the universe to ransom and sets up a prison break on raulf to set things in motion if he can defeat a group of the most feared individuals in the galaxy who are armed to the teeth and wanting revenge he figures he can defeat anyone the game features levels across fifteen different worlds and has six playable characters mamma fwank bounca vox butch and capn hands two characters may be selected in cooperative mode to complete the game a mission briefing will begin at the start of every mission aided by a full motion video sequence loaded s gameplay is similar to that of gauntlet which requires the player to move room to room killing everything in sight everything of which will try to kill the player also score can be increased by looting the bloodied remains of enemies there are some puzzle and exploration elements and powerups and ammo can be found the levels progress by collecting keycards capable of unlocking doors the player can zoom in to their character by pressing r2 or zoom out by pressing l2 at the end of each level the game tallies the player s greed factor accuracy and body count on a 0100 scale in order to give the player s career prospects ranging from as low as social worker to as high as genocidal maniac etc and final score loaded features 21 compositions by neil biggin plus 2 tracks by patrick pat phelan and 2 more by pop will eat itself kick to kill and rsvp  the game was specially designed so that it could be placed inside a cd player and used as an audio cd skipping track 1 which contained the code for the game  this would then enable the listener to play the full soundtrack including many hidden tracks there are 25 audio tracks in total on the cd the hidden tracks were brief demos and were never used ingame the game received mixed reviews with critics noting that it was nt exactly a cerebral game but with others noting that it was nonetheless fun and addictive critics are still divided even today which is evident in the reviews of the game on the gamefaqs website however the general consensus was positive and loaded currently has an 82 rating on mobygames loaded was noted in many reviews for its violence everything living encountered by the player must be killed often resulting in explosions of gore on june 29 1996 loaded was put on the infamous german index by the bpjs the largest character in the game a veritable giant mamma s real name is unknown and wears a diaper baby bonnet wooley hat and bunny slippers however both the guards and prisoners of the raulf prison planet are all terrified of him due the fact he has a tendency to crush to death anybody who comes near him in a mammoth bonecruching organbursting bear hug which to mamma is an innocent gesture of friendship he then believes the crushed bodies are asleep and he will go off looking for his next cuddle mamma was abandoned as a babe in the busiest star port in the galaxy a place where nobody has any time for anybody else he is totally without education manners and most of all the other things which are generally regarded as civilized he blunders through life using his very limited vocabulary to get him through all manner of circumstance the only word he knows and the only thing that keeps him going is the word mamma lending him his name obviously he missed something as an infant his lineage is therefore something of an unknown quantity but one thing is certain his mother was friendly with something large and simian quite a scary and unpredictable man to have around even if you are scary and unpredictable yourself mamma s weapon is the plasma gun and his bomb is the ripple grenade used when mamma creates a wave through the ground that instantly kills a large amount of foes around him this attack can travel through walls and doors mamma has a very good armor rating but a slow speed featured on the cover of the game fwank is a very heavilybuilt and thoroughly psychotic man donning a bank bag over his face with the bag painted making him resemble a clown almost childlike in demeanour although not so much as mamma  he has a notable lisp which causes him to mispronounce words rs are substituted with ws  providing his nickname fwank killed his parents and his pwobation officer when he was young and the graphic novel explains that he was lobotomized at age six although his true name is never revealed his body is described as that of a steroideating wilderbeest who does nt shower fwank looks upon other lifeforms as toys for his amusement or worse expendable cardboard targets at a fairground attraction the only things he cares about is his collection of teddy bears especially the one he calls percy and keeping his weapon well oiled fwank makes one concession to his fellow lifeforms he ties a mood balloon to his back pack indicating the general ballpark of his demeanour green for chuckly yellow for i need space and red for i would nt ask if i were you  fwank s weapon of choice is a cannon that fires neutron spheres and his bombs are homing teddies a floating armada of teddy bears containing explosives that eviscerate nearby foes this attack can kill enemies stationed directly behind a door but cannot travel through walls and doors however the teddies can follow fwank and stay in use longer to attack incoming enemies fwank has stats almost similar to mamma fwank has a good armor rating but a slow speed not quite as big as mamma the tuxedowearing bounca is nonetheless a mammoth of a man and still towers over most other lifeforms he has spent his adult life as a security guard personal bodyguard and mostly as a bouncer certainly one of the most widely travelled and employed organisms in the history of the galaxy he has seen amazing sights that even the most intrepid galactic explorers would go green at hidden planets lost continents and the like bounca has a slight problem though he is incredibly thick not just a bit thick enormously thick all of his experiences amount to a big fat zero because the only thing he finds interesting is slappin some innocent geeza about a bit you might as well have sent a baboon around the galaxy and then questioned it about its experiences as it is probably more perceptive and definitely less likely to kill you for asking he lost his lower jaw fighting an alien monster twice as big as him who was trying to enter a doorway bounca was watching over bounca won the fight but had to have his lower jaw replaced with a giant metallic serrated muzzle his weapon is a missile launcher and his bomb is the frag missile a randomlymoving burst of shrapnel this attack can not travel through walls and doors the allrounder of the group in stats bounca has a medium armor rating and a moderate speed the only female in the game vox is a former sound engineer disc jockey and glamour model often called the siren due to her mixed beauty and extremely sharp tongue and temper and overall devastating sexy countenance vox uses modified sound and music technology to kill foes in the game self developed with the aid of gabbist monks an order who take the vow to never have a second s peace and quiet and are masters in the art of amplification the device they collaborated on is slung across her back and has a number of rapmaster microphones channelling sound to it via boom mikes on her visor the sound waves created act as shock waves and are capable of turning vox s enemies into bubbling pools of protoplasm her weapon is the hail flail and her ultra bomb is the sonic blast an extremely potent and charged burst of lethal sound waves this attack can travel through walls and doors vox is small and light with a poor armor rating but is the fastest character in speed making it easy for her to even dodge bullets a muscular balding transvestite man that wears ladies dresses in combat and dislikes those that find his crossdressing funny he brutally murders anybody who snickers at his attire the game manual and also the graphic novel explain that it is not through choice however every time he escapes he simply grabs the nearest item to hand which unfortunately by a staggering twist of fate always happens to be women s clothing in some form butch s favoured weapon is a flamethrower named the flaming queen and his bomb is the explosive ring the release of fireballs in all directions within butch s radius this attack can travel through walls and doors instead of splattering enemies into a bloody heap the flaming queen and the explosive ring actually chars enemies bodies on contact he has a medium armor rating and fast speed although not as fast as vox making him the second fastest character in the game a piratelike character with freakishly large hands and forearms a cowboy hat and an exposed ribcage capn hands has been around for centuries and nothing is known of his origins although the rumors range from being a pirate who was operating in the caribbean during the golden age of piracy of the late 1600s or even a cowboy from the old american west of the 1800s up until recently before he was captured by the authorities capn hands was a leader of the feared and despised cirates a group of cyberneticallyenhanced space pirates only his head is an original part of his human body and that too is rotten to the core the rest of his powerful frame is an old and outofdate cyborg design which he could have replaced over 200 years ago when technology took a giant leap forward but he likes it another reason he keeps this ancient and obsolete skeleton is for its amazing array of original art and engravings which decorate the majority of its panels showing his numerous exploits and stories through space he has kept the inmates of raulf prison amused and beguiled for hours on end with stories of how he acquired them and with his famous dancing bare lady design only his close friends and people who are about to expire horribly generally get to see that though  the truth is capn hands cannot remember who he was before he became a cybernetic skeletal pirate simply because it was so long ago and his mind is nt what it used to be his weapons are a pair of old flintlock muskets which he has customized for rapid energy fire although he has made sure they still retain their trademark sound of old his bomb is the vortex bomb a curtain of dark energy that shreds enemies to pieces this attack can travel through walls and doors capn hands has an average armor rating and moderate speed being the third fastest character behind vox and butch less than a year after the original game was released a sequel was released also for the playstation and the pc entitled reloaded developed and published by the same companies it featured the same game engine and even the game menus are the same although it is a game engine with slightly improved graphics four characters from the original game are also in reloaded such as mamma bounca butch and capn hands vox however is not present in the game and is replaced by two new female characters a pinkhaired cannibalistic sex symbol named the consumer and a malfunctioning android nun named sister magpie via cheat code sister magpie can unlock hidden character fwank from the previous game for use in reloaded if unlocked fwank is the best character in reloaded with the most speed and best armor all of the returning characters have new weapons and or variations of their costumes there are twelve bloodsoaked new worlds to annihilate much bigger than the levels encountered in the previous game and with the added bonus of being able to morph the surrounding terrain with highpowered weaponry and explosives the game will be coming soon on psn store as it can already be seen listed by the esrb website that it s coming to psn as a psone classic fub the antagonist of loaded had his body destroyed at the end of the previous game although his brain fled in an escape pod landing on a harsh desert world keebutt5 his brain has been implanted into the body of a chiselled bronzed young artist hermit named manuel auto and then he murdered the loyal surgeons responsible for giving him a new body reincarnated and renamed cheb which stands for charming handsome erudite bastard the former raving lunatic supervillain has taken on some of the aspects of his host body the creative artistic and thoughtful manuel auto with his matter manipulation powers cheb plans to transform whole planets into works of art and genuis starting with his own body which he grows to the size of a small moon once again the group of bloodthirsty antiheroes gather to bring him down once and for all and set off for keebutt5  reloaded despite having notably better graphics then the original game was not as well received and currently has a rating of 48 on mobygames the soundtrack however this time entirely composed by neil biggin was acclaimed as better than the original and indeed one of the best aspects of the game like the previous game it could be played as an audio cd on june 28 1997 reloaded was put on the infamous german index by the bpjs like its predecessor  the lyceum ancient greek î›ïîºîµî¹î¿î½ lykeion was a gymnasium and public meeting place in classical athens named after the god of the grove that housed the lyceum apollo lyceus apollo was also the greek wolfgod though best known for its connection with aristotle and the peripatetic school he led there the lyceum was in existence long before aristotle s formal founding in 334 or 335 bc and continued under several heads until the roman general sulla sacked athens in 86 bc the remains of the lyceum were discovered in modern athens in 1996 speculation suggests that pericles or pisistratus may have originally opened the first building of the lyceum as a gymnasium in the fifth or sixth centuries bc though the lyceum grounds would have predated the gymnasium in the early years of the lyceum the head of the greek army was said to have had an office there which would have made it easy for him to be involved in the military training and exercises which the grounds were used for the lyceum s use as a recreational gym and military training base is supported by the existence of wrestling rings a racetrack and seats for athlothetai the judges of athletic events a long list of philosophers and sophists gave talks at the lyceum prior to aristotle including prodicus of ceos protagoras and rhapsodes the most famous philosophers to have taught there however were isocrates plato of the academy and the bestknown athenian teacher socrates in addition to military training and educational pursuits the lyceum also housed athenian assembly meetings before the pnyx became the official meeting place in the fifth century bc cult practices of various groups were also held at the lyceum in 335 bc athens fell under macedonian rule and aristotle aged 50 returned from asia upon his return to athens aristotle began teaching regularly in the morning in the lyceum and founded an official school the lyceum after his morning lessons aristotle would frequently lecture on the grounds for the public and manuscripts of his compiled lectures were eventually circulated the group of scholars who followed the aristotelian doctrine came to be known as the peripatetics due to aristotle s tendency to walk as he taught aristotle s main foci as a teacher were cooperative research an idea which he founded through his natural history work and systematic collection of philosophical works to contribute to his library his students were assigned historical or scientific research projects as part of their studies the school was also student run the students elected a new student administrator to work with the school leadership every ten days allowing all the students to become involved in turn before returning to athens aristotle had been the tutor of alexander of macedonia who became the great conqueror alexander the great throughout his conquests of various regions alexander collected plant and animal specimens for aristotle s research allowing aristotle to develop the first zoo and botanical garden in existence it is also suspected that alexander donated what would be the equivalent of more than 4 million dollars to the lyceum in 322 bc aristotle was forced to flee athens with his family when the political leadership reacted against the macedonians again and his previously published works supporting macedonian rule left him a target he passed on his lyceum to theophrastus and died later that year in chalcis near his hometown theophrastus placed a provision in his will that left the lyceum library which at this point included both his and aristotle s work as well as student research philosophical historical texts and histories of philosophy to his supposed follower neleus however the seniors of the lyceum placed strato as the next leader and upon his retirement from the school in the mid third century bc neleus divorced the lyceum from its library and took all of the books with him to skepsis in mysia the library then disappeared for several centuries until it appears to have been bought from neleus heirs in the first century bc and returned to the school however when sulla attacked athens the books were shipped to rome throughout their travels one fifth of aristotle s works were lost and thus are not a part of the modern aristotelian collection still what did remain of aristotle s works and the rest of the library were arranged and edited for school use between 73 and 20 bc supposedly by andronicus of rhodes the lyceum s eleventh leader since then the remaining works have been translated and widely distributed providing much of the modern knowledge of historic philosophy as head of the lyceum theophrastus continued aristotle s foci of observation collaborative research and documentation of philosophical history thus making his own contributions to the library most notably as the first organizer of botany though he was not a citizen of athens he had met aristotle in the 340s in his homeland of lesbos he managed to buy land near the main gym of the lyceum as well as several buildings for the library and additional workspace in 315 bc theophrastus also continued his own work while teaching and demonstrated his devotion to learning and education by leaving the land of the lyceum to his friends to continue their work in education in philosophy in the nonprivate tradition of the school upon his death during the era of theophrastus and his successor strato of lampsacus the lyceum experienced a decline until it fell with the rest of athens in 86 bc there is some thought that the lyceum was refounded in the first century ad by andronicus of rhodes and no matter its secondary founder it once again flourished as a philosophical school in the second century and continued until athens was once again sacked in 267 ad theophrastus headed the lyceum for 36 years between aristotle s exile from athens in 322 bc until his own death in 286 bc there is some speculation that both aristotle and theophrastus were buried in the gardens of the lyceum though no graves have been positively identified theophrastus was followed by strato who served as head until 268 lyco of troas likely aristo of ceos critolaus diodorus of tyre and erymneus were the next several heads of the school additionally andronicus of rhodes served as the eleventh head at various points in the history of the lyceum numerous scholars and students walked its parapetoi though some of the most notable include eudemus a mathematical historian aristoxenus who wrote works on music and dicaearchus a prolific writer on topics including ethics politics psychology and geography additionally medicinal historian meno and an eventual ruler of athens demetrius of phaleron spent time at the school demetrius of phaleron ruled athens as a proxy leader for a dynasty from 317307 bc during 1996 excavation to clear space for athens new museum of modern art the remains of aristotle s lyceum were uncovered descriptions from the works of ancient philosophers hint at the location of the grounds speculated to be somewhere just outside the eastern boundary of ancient athens near the rivers ilissus and eridanus and mount lykabettos which is just where the remains were found in presentday athens the excavation site is located between rigilis and vasilissis sofias 200 yards from the british embassy and behind the war museum the first excavations revealed a gymnasium and wrestling area but further work has uncovered the majority of what is believed to have withstood the erosion caused to the region by nearby architecture s placement and drainage upon realizing the magnitude of the discovery beneath the parking lot to be transformed into the museum secondary plans were made for nearby construction of the art museum so that it could be combined with a lyceum outdoor museum and give tourists easy access to both attractions there are plans for a large outdoor roof to be placed over the lyceum remains and the area was slated to open for the public in summer 2009  the manchester and salford yeomanry cavalry was a shortlived yeomanry regiment formed in response to social unrest in northern england in 1817 the volunteer regiment became notorious for its involvement in the 1819 peterloo massacre in which as many as 15 people were killed and 400700 were injured often referred to simply as the manchester yeomanry the regiment was disbanded in 1824 after the end of the napoleonic wars in 1815 many textile workers in the newly industrialised towns of northern england lost their jobs as a result of an economic slump connected to the reduced need for war materiel even for those still employed rising food prices made life very difficult at the same time writers such as william cobbett were denouncing the inequity of the electoral system as evidenced by rotten boroughs poor mill workers were a naturally sympathetic audience for a succession of radical organisers and speakers who spoke of electoral reform and alleviating poverty this radical movement deeply worried many supporters of the tory party particularly in northern england the fear of popular revolt had begun with the american and french revolutions in the late 18thcentury many tory supporters such as mill owners landowners and tradesmen saw the agitation for suffrage as little less than sedition the tory party strongly opposed the proposed reforms on 10 march 1817 about 5000 people met in st peters field in central manchester aiming to march to london to set their grievances before the prince regent each person carried a rug or blanket leading them to be named blanketeers the march was quickly suppressed but manchester tories worried that they lacked protection from the hostile masses this fear spurred a petition with more than 100 signatures to the boroughreeves and constables of manchester and salford demanding a meeting to establish a yeomanry corps the constables organized the meeting for 19 june 1817 wheeler s manchester chronicle reported that those present resolved that under the present circumstances it is expedient to form a body of yeomanry cavalry in the towns and neighborhood of manchester and salford the newspaper noted that government allowances were available for uniforms and that if neighboring towns formed their own corps they might be later combined each man was to provide his own horse thomas trafford owner of substantial lands in lancashire and cheshire was commissioned as the cavalry s first majorcommandant on 23 august 1817 as with many yeomanry regiments of the time it was a relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among shopkeepers and tradesmen a notice in the london gazette on 6 october 1818 listed the appointment of officers to the corps over the past year on 16 august 1819 major trafford and lieutenant colonel guy lestrange the overall military commander in manchester were sent notes by a magistrate william hulton urging them to dispatch troops to a public meeting on voting reform being addressed by the orator henry hunt the notes were handed to two horsemen standing by the manchester and salford yeomanry were stationed just a short distance away in portland street and so received their note first trafford dispatched 116 officers and men of the manchester and salford yeomanry who immediately drew their swords and galloped towards st peter s field one trooper in a frantic attempt to catch up knocked down a woman in cooper street causing the death of her child when he was thrown from her arms twoyearold william fildes was the first casualty of peterloo special constables were already present at the meeting but no troops sixty cavalrymen of the manchester and salford yeomanry led by captain hugh hornby birley a local factory owner arrived at the house from where the magistrates were watching some reports allege that they were drunk andrews the chief constable instructed birley that he had an arrest warrant which he needed assistance to execute birley was asked to take his cavalry to the hustings to allow the speakers to be removed it was by then about 1 40 pm major trafford himself appears not to have been present for the disastrous attack on the assembled crowd that followed the route towards the hustings between the special constables was narrow and as the inexperienced horses were thrust further and further into the crowd they reared and plunged as people tried to get out of their way the arrest warrant had been given to the deputy constable joseph nadin who followed behind the yeomanry as the cavalry pushed towards the speakers stand they became stuck in the crowd and in panic started to hack about them with their sabres on his arrival at the stand nadin arrested hunt johnson and a number of others including john tyas the reporter from the times according to tyas the yeomanry s progress through the crowd had provoked a hail of bricks and stones and caused them to lose all command of temper their mission to execute the arrest warrant having been achieved they then set about destroying the banners and flags carried by the crowd from his vantage point william hulton perceived the unfolding events as an assault on the yeomanry and on lestrange s arrival at 1 50 pm at the head of his hussars he ordered them into the field to disperse the crowd with the words good god sir do nt you see they are attacking the yeomanry disperse the meeting the 15th hussars formed themselves into a line stretching across the eastern end of st peter s field and charged into the crowd at about the same time the cheshire yeomanry charged from the southern edge of the field at first the crowd had some difficulty in dispersing as the main exit route into peter street was blocked by the 88th infantry regiment standing with bayonets fixed one officer of the 15th hussars was heard trying to restrain the by now out of control manchester and salford yeomanry who were cutting at every one they could reach for shame for shame gentlemen forbear forbear the people cannot get away within ten minutes the crowd was dispersed at the cost of at least 11 dead and over 600 injured the government and landowners viewed the yeomanry s actions at peterloo as a courageous defence against insurrection following the massacre on 27 august 1819 lord sidmouth sent a message of thanks from the prince regent to major trafford among others however public horror at the actions of the yeomanry grew after the massacre major trafford resigned his commission in 1820 and the yeomanry corps was disbanded on 9 june 1824  matt saracen is a fictional

ways matt gives his ticket to landry who tells him that going around the city with his grandma would be no fun  the former soviet republic of georgia has a monarchic tradition that traces its origins to the hellenistic period the medieval kingdom of georgia ruled by the bagrationi dynasty has left behind a legacy that lasts in georgia even in modern times the qualities and symbols associated with the bagrationi monarchy have been crucial in the making of the georgian nation and the subsequent construction of national history their rule ended with the annexation of georgian lands by the russian empire early in the 19th century although several branches of the dynasty survive to this day the monarchic restoration was considered by various royalist groups throughout the 20th century although georgia s politics has been taking place in the framework of a presidential republic since the nation regained its independence from the soviet union in 1991 the debate on monarchy particularly its constitutional form has never actually ceased the issue came up most recently amid a political crisis in late 2007 the russian empire absorbed the two principal georgian kingdoms those of kartlikakheti and imereti in 1801 and 1810 respectively the members of the dispossessed royal dynasty fomented a series of rebellions against russian rule but all of them failed the russian administration using a combination of military pacification and diplomatic persuasion succeeded in winning a degree of loyalty of local elites the bagrationi princes themselves subsequently bowed to the inevitable and reconciled with a fait accompli shortly after the decembrist revolt of 1825 royalist georgians in st petersburg and moscow urged on by the grandsons of the penultimate king of georgia erekle ii the princes okropir and dimitri tried to convince georgian students in the two russian cities that georgia should be independent under the bagrationi dynasty okropir visited tiflis in 1829 and helped found a secret society with the aim of restoring the georgian monarchy inspired by the french revolution of 1830 and the polish insurrection of 18301831 the conspirators were united in their antirussian sentiment but divided in their program although the majority favored a restoration of the bagrationi to the georgian throne the planned coup was prevented by the police in 1832 the loyalty of georgian nobility to the russian tsar won by liberal politics of the imperial viceroy prince vorontsov 18441854  began to fade in the 1860s yet after the georgian royalistled conspiracy in 1832 no georgian movement or political party called for an outright independence until world war i during the world war i years georgian ã©migrã©s under the guidance of prince matchabelli established a national committee in berlin which considered a reinstatement of a monarchy in georgia under the german protectorate an influential lobby of the idea was otto von lossow who suggested putting the german prince joachim on the georgian throne however following the russian revolution of 1917 georgians restored their independent state in the form of a democratic republic may 26 1918  the result of a longtime domination of georgian political scene by social democrats georgian nobility including the scions of the former royal dynasty lent their support to a new republic as a contemporary western observer noted like that of france the georgian nobility has a social rather than a political significance the people are democratic in spirit there is not the least chance of a revival of monarchy in georgia and the nobles will hardly have more political weight than their individual merit entitles the democratic republic of georgia fell to soviet russia s red army invasion in 1921 the subsequent political repressions especially during the abortive august uprising in 1924 forced many of the bagrationi family members to flee the soviet union some of them died in purges one of the ã©migrã©s prince irakli of the house of mukhrani a collateral branch of the bagrationi dynasty  19091977  tried to enlist the support of european powers for a georgian monarchist cause after settling in spain before the war prince irakli founded what he called the royal house of georgia and sought support from european governments for a georgian monarchy independent from stalin s soviet union when prince irakli died in spain in 1977 george became first in line to the royal house of georgia and was recognised as such albeit as a formality by the government and parliament of the new independent republic in 1991 despite rival claims from others the legitimate rights of this house to the throne have frequently been questioned however due to the fact the patrilineal descendants of the last king of georgia the bagrationgruzinsky still survive in georgia this line is currently represented by prince nugzar bagrationgruzinsky born 1950  the heir male of georgia s last reigning king george xii however the two branches acted to resolve this conflict by uniting through the marriage of david of mukhrani with nugzar s daughter anna in february 2009 as georgia was moving towards independence from the soviet union early in the 1990s monarchical restoration was an issue on the fringes of politics but without actual candidates to a throne and popular support for monarchy various georgian political groups tried to negotiate a return of jorge de bagration head of the royal house of georgia and even sent a delegation to madrid to persuade the reluctant prince some political activists especially those associated with the national democratic party speculated that a constitutional monarchy in georgia would help scotch any efforts by moscow to keep georgia inside the soviet union after georgia s declaration of independence on april 9 1991 weak and fractious opposition groups again raised the issue of restoration hoping to neutralize zviad gamsakhurdia the first popularly elected president of georgia and his authoritarian tendencies during the rule of eduard shevardnadze 19922003  no serious consideration was given to monarchist ideas although several minor political parties including the union of georgian traditionalists led by the former parliamentary chairman akaki asatiani continued to advocate a constitutional monarchy as a form of georgia s government the debate on a constitutional monarchy was revitalized with the emerging political crisis in georgia later in 2007 the october 7 2007 sermon of catholicospatriarch ilia ii the popular head of the georgian orthodox church gave an impetus to a renewed political debate the patriarch who has always sympathized with the idea of constitutional monarchy said during his sunday service at the cathedral of the holy trinity that the restoration of the royal dynasty was a desirable dream of the georgian people he also emphasized that if the people of georgia chose this model of governance a candidate to the crown should be selected among representatives of the royal dynasty and he should be suitably raised to be king from childhood the patriarch s sermon gave an unexpected continuation to the political crisis in georgia although the patriarch s sympathies towards the monarchy is not something new for the regular parish to hear several opposition parties immediately seized on the opportunity to advance their slogan georgia without a president a reference to the model of parliamentary rule advocated by the georgian opposition many politicians expressed their support to a constitutional monarchy with a transitional stage in the form of a parliamentary republic the authorities response to the calls for a monarchy was restrained nino burjanadze a chairperson of the parliament of georgia has expressed skepticism about the idea and stated that georgia will not be able to decide on such an important issue until its territorial integrity is restored referring to the secession in abkhazia and south ossetia president mikheil saakashvili having jokingly remarked on his remote bagratid ancestry said that serious considerations are necessary on this issue so that we do not add new problems to the already existing ones o giga bokeria an influential member of the parliament from saakashvili s united national movement tried to softpedal the patriarch s statement the patriarch did nt suggest establishing monarchy today he meant this may happen after georgia resolves its fundamental problems o he later alleged that the opposition s call for a constitutional monarchy was merely a populist move they speak about constitutional monarchy here and do not say anything about it abroad this is their doublestandard policy o ilia ii himself has avoided further comment on the topic meanwhile the opposition new rights party which stood aside from the antigovernment demonstrations staged by a coalition of ten opposition parties in october and november 2007 became the only major political group to add a more nuanced view on the establishment of a constitutional monarchy to their agenda they issued a special declaration supporting the idea and proposing to hold a referendum on the issue a suggestion which was also included in the preelection campaign of david gamkrelidze a candidate from the new rights industrialists bloc for the early presidential elections held on january 5 2008 a monarchy option has always caused an ambiguous resonance in georgia on the one hand the monarchy is considered a symbol of georgian unity and independence and on the other hand it belongs to a remote past with a significant gap of more than 200 years in monarchic tradition thus according to one survey conducted back in 1998 only 16 3 of 828 respondents believed that a monarchy would be a good or very good form of government for georgia when asked how suitable they think various types of government were or would be for georgia there are no significant recent public opinion surveys available though a small and limited internet poll at the medianews agency website shows as of december 23 2007 only a 2 support for monarchy critics point out that the wide majority of georgians do not have internet service or participated in the survey and therefor reject the results the skeptics say the restoration of the monarchy is technically impossible due to several reasons including the number of candidates and an unsettled question of succession to the georgian throne additionally they believe that the criteria for selecting the king will lead to major disagreements the supporters of constitutional monarchy continue to argue that this form of state would best protect the interests of citizens of georgia a monarch would reign not rule and act as a safeguard of stability and national unity they see the return to monarchy as a historical justice referring to the fact that the native royal dynasty has never been rejected or overthrown by the georgian people but was dispossessed by a foreign power ie russia   morning and noon a memoir is an autobiographical book written by former united states secretary of state dean acheson in 1965 in it

american preparation for war in 1940 charles poore book reviewer for the new york times summed up his response in his review title the glow is mellow the substance diamondhard as to the book s overall content he wrote since mr acheson disavows formal autobiography at the outset we are spared the obscure bayous with which zealous hoarders of their own accomplishments fill out their landscapes o in describing acheson s style he wrote like a good letter writer mr acheson talks less about himself than about others he unfailingly catches traits that make people live before your eyes the new york times also published a review of this book by stephen k bailey the dean of the maxwell graduate school of citizenship and public affairs at syracuse university and a former mayor of acheson s home town of middletown connecticut bailey commented on what middletown had meant to acheson and acheson to middletown and speculated that the author s experiences growing up there had prepared him for his later remarkable performance in public service bailey summarized his impression of the book with what comes through is a man disciplined in work and style who has never lost his zest for life who loves freedom and appreciates its cost who delights in the tricks of reason and the safety valves of ribaldry who understands but is not cowed by the perversities and narrow tolerances which mark and limit every civilized advance  targjei augundsson 1801 november 21 1872  better known as myllarguten meaning the millerboy  is arguably the most acknowledged norwegian folk musician to this day and by far the most legendary targjei was born in sauherad telemark the date of his birth is disputed the years range from 1799 to 1801  and some say his father augund was only registered as the father of the boy in the local church documentation  he married gunhild the mother in october 1801 targjei was already born at the time usually farmers of the norwegian serfdom stock is not very well documented often moving from homestead to homestead myllarguten s father was a country fiddler one of many at the time and targjei was going for the fiddle from early age but it is told he feared his father would beat him if he tried the instrument so he sneaked himself to playing while his father was outside and at work at the local mill his father s profession gave targjei his name the millerboy one day the father returned early from work and heard someone inside playing and asked astonished who the player was his wife gunhild had to admit it was his son targjei from then on augund his father trained him but the boy was so eager his father had to give him away to other fiddlers in the area amongst his teachers were the fiddlers knut lurã¥s from tinn jon kjos from ã…motsdal mattis flathus from sauherad and ã˜ystein langedrag from bã¸ the latter had been a soldier in the napoleonic wars and had some experience with military music which influenced his style and to a degree the style of myllarguten the fiddler he regarded the best of his teachers was knut lurã¥s one of two colleague fiddlers he really appreciated as his reputation grew targjei was known as a hard critic and a merciless competitor he did not like to be bested at playing the other he held in esteem was hã¥vard gibã¸en regarded as his traditional counterpart in folk music from telemark hã¥vard was the only fiddler of whom targjei would say he is the master of us all life as a fiddler was a life on the road he soon got reputation and played from early on at weddings and county feasts all over telemark he soon made longer journeys and spanned the country as far as bergen and gudbrandsdalen he eventually got married with ingebjã¸rg eddandshaugen from vinje and had ten children by her of whom at least four sons became fiddlers themselves and through them the music from targjei has been passed on down to this day in telemark myllarguten was a difficult person an imaginative musical artist but painstakingly slow in all other tasks than playing he could use a day on matters other more practical persons finished in a couple of hours he was eager to learn dancetunes and turned them around in his own way making them longer and richer than before thus he laid the ground for a brand new way of playing the hardanger fiddle in telemark in 1831 he met ole bull in bergen and became his friend for life bull was on a short visit between tours and was at the time looking for a personal and national expression he had not yet opened his mind for the rural music but when hearing myllarguten he got exactly what he had looked for later he said there has not been a one fiddler that has made me content in such a way the two understood each other and soon became friends bull wrote down some of the tunes he heard and borrowed myllarguten s fiddle and in turn played classical music for the fiddler they both came enriched from the meeting and bull always played some norwegian folk music on his concerts after this thus he made the rural tunes known to a larger public for the first time the meeting had lasting impact in the evolving romantic nationalism in norway after this meeting they did not meet again for 17 years until bull endeavored to make a concert with myllarguten in christiania february 1849 when romantic nationalism was at its very peak in norway the concert became a commercial success and the hall was packed with 1500 excited listeners among them some from telemark who had got free tickets the known author aasmund olavsson vinje decided not to go afraid that the concert might go awry for the sensible fiddler and would not be held responsible as a man from the same district which he was when going on stage myllarguten had to break his crate open with a knife and was delayed several minutes this made him nervous and he started playing other tunes than the appointed but he soon played himself into ecstasy as was his wont and the audience cheered newspapers called him a true child of nature and praised him with eulogies and poems on the other hand the urban audience was more excited by the event than the music as the traditional music was and is a music for trained ears when the romantic wave died down myllarguten became a hasbeen and was regarded as nothing more than a drunken telemark farmer the concerts gave him money to raise a farm in rauland and the more experienced farmer rikard aslaksson berge helped him in this myllarguten had played at his wedding and was a regular guest at the farm thus his music was passed on to rikard s sons and from them to his grandson eivind groven in spite of his successes abroad targjei was not able to keep his money and had to leave his farm in the end the last years of his life he was tired of playing and became gradually harder to ask sometimes he became depressed and cursed both his fiddle and ole bull and all the rest he felt alone frustrated and lost but was still appreciated by his own community myllarguten died a pauper in 1872 and his funeral was timid only one single boat and no flowers it was custom to travel to the church by water crossing the lake totak that was easier than taking the road  he is buried at the cemetery at rauland in telemark it was reckoned a pity that this should befall the greatest fiddler in norway but he is well remembered and through his descendants passed on a vivid musical tradition that lives on in telemark to this very day all the county honors his memory a memorial stone was later set up at his grave myllarguten was from the beginning a traditional folk musician schooled and educated in local tradition the meeting with ole bull had a lasting impact on his style and he began to explore the limits of his instrument i new and more advanced ways he also turned his tonality more towards the classical ideals rather than the more rural blue note in 1853 carl schart an organist in bergen transcribed five of myllarguten s tunes and those came later into print this example shows a vivid musical mind and a great performer most of the sources for myllarguten s life were written down from living memory accounted by people who had met the fiddler and his close relatives other sources exist as articles by romantic nationalists in norway who met the fiddler and described him all the material was collected and edited by the folklorist rikard berge himself from telemark and grandson of rikard aslaksson as mentioned above he had firsthand information and collected material for twelve years from 1896 to 1908 meeting many older people who remembered myllarguten thus he put together a thorough and useful biography and a valuable source concerning the meeting of ole bull and myllarguten told by the farmer rikard aslaksson berge as rendered by myllarguten himself tor vaa from rauland and gregar torgeirsson myllarguten s son the latter also told of the concert in christiania which is also well documented from contemporary written material concerning the fiddler s childhood told by gunnhild flatastã¸yl daughterinlaw ingebjã¸rg pilodden from sauherad and gregar torgeirsson myllarguten s technical abilities and musical style ã˜ystein hovdestad vinje among others his funeral signe ã˜ydgarden rauland she was an eyewitness to the event all the material is edited and published in rikard berge

into something he believed was a worthwhile cause  nova was a highpower laser built at the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl in 1984 which conducted advanced inertial confinement fusion icf experiments until its dismantling in 1999 nova was the first icf experiment built with the intention of reaching ignition a chain reaction of nuclear fusion that releases a large amount of energy although nova failed in this goal the data it generated clearly defined the problem as being mostly a result of magnetohydrodynamic instability leading to the design of the national ignition facility nova s successor nova also generated considerable amounts of data on highdensity matter physics regardless of the lack of ignition which is useful both in fusion power and nuclear weapons research inertial confinement fusion icf devices use drivers to rapidly heat the outer layers of a target in order to compress it the target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel typically a mix of deuterium and tritium the heat of the laser burns the surface of the pellet into a plasma which explodes off the surface the remaining portion of the target is driven inwards due to newton s third law eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density the rapid blowoff also creates a shock wave that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel when it reaches the center of the fuel and meets the shock from the other side of the target the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it if the temperature and density of that small spot can be raised high enough fusion reactions will occur the fusion reactions release highenergy particles some of which primarily alpha particles collide with the high density fuel around it and slow down this heats the fuel further and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuelhigh enough density and temperaturethis heating process can result in a chain reaction burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction this is a condition known as ignition which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion and the release of significant amounts of energy to date most icf experiments have used lasers to heat the targets calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles as well as creating a suitable shock wave the energy must also be focused extremely evenly across the target s outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core although other drivers have been suggested notably heavy ions driven in particle accelerators lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features llnl s history with the icf program starts with physicist john nuckolls who predicted in 1972 that ignition could be achieved with laser energies about 1 kj while high gain would require energies around 1 mj although this sounds very low powered compared to modern machines at the time it was just beyond the state of the art and led to a number of programs to produce lasers in this power range prior to the construction of nova llnl had designed and built a series of everlarger lasers that explored the problems of basic icf design llnl was primarily interested in the nd glass laser which at the time was one of a very few highenergy laser designs known llnl had decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide eg antares laser los alamos national laboratory or krf eg nike laser naval research laboratory  building large nd glass lasers had not been attempted before and llnl s early research focussed primarily on how to make these devices one problem was the homogeneity of the beams even minor variations in intensity of the beams would result in selffocusing in the air and glass optics in a process known as kerr lensing the resulting beam included small filaments of extremely high light intensity so high it would damage the glass optics of the device this problem was solved in the cyclops laser with the introduction of the spatial filtering technique cyclops was followed by the argus laser of greater power which explored the problems of controlling more than one beam and illuminating a target more evenly all of this work culminated in the shiva laser a proofofconcept design for a high power system that included 20 separate laser amplifiers that were directed around the target to illuminate it it was during experiments with shiva that another serious unexpected problem appeared the infrared light generated by the nd glass lasers was found to interact very strongly with the electrons in the plasma created during the initial heating through the process of stimulated raman scattering this process referred to as hot electron preheating carried away a great amount of the laser s energy and also caused the core of the target to heat before it reached maximum compression this meant that much less energy was being deposited in the center of the collapse both due to the reduction in implosion energy as well as the outward force of the heated core although it was known that shorter wavelengths would reduce this problem it had earlier been expected that the ir frequencies used in shiva would be short enough this proved not to be the case a solution to this problem was explored in the form of efficient frequency multipliers optical devices that combine several photons into one of higher energy and thus frequency these devices were quickly introduced and tested experimentally on the omega laser and others proving effective although the process is only about 50 efficient and half the original laser power is lost the resulting ultraviolet light couples much more efficiently to the target plasma and is much more effective in collapsing the target to high density with these solutions in hand llnl decided to build a device with the power needed to produce ignition conditions design started in the late 1970s with construction following shortly starting with the testbed novette laser to validate the basic beamline and frequency multiplier design this was a time of repeated energy crises in the us and funding was not difficult to find given the large amounts of money available for alternative energy and nuclear weapons research during the initial construction phase nuckolls found an error in his calculations and an october 1979 review chaired by john foster jr of trw confirmed that there was no way nova would reach ignition the nova design was then modified into a smaller design that added frequency conversion to 351 nm light which would increase coupling efficiency the new nova emerged as a system with ten laser amplifiers or beamlines each beamline consisted of a series of nd glass amplifiers separated by spatial filters and other optics for cleaning up the resulting beams although techniques for folding the beamlines were known as early as shiva they were not well developed at this point in time nova ended up with a single fold in its layout and the laser bay containing the beamlines was long to the casual observer it appears to contain twenty long beamlines but due to the fold each of the ten is actually almost long in terms of optical path length prior to firing the nd glass amplifiers are first pumped with a series of xenon flash lamps surrounding them some of the light produced by the lamps is captured in the glass leading to a population inversion that allows for amplification via stimulated emission this process is quite inefficient and only about 1 to 1 5 of the power fed into the lamps is actually turned into laser energy in order to produce the sort of laser power required for nova the lamps had to be very large fed power from a large bank of capacitors located under the laser bay the flash also generates a large amount of heat which distorts the glass requiring time for the lamps and glass to cool before they can be fired again this limits nova to about six firings a day at the maximum once pumped and ready for firing a small pulse of laser light is fed into the beamlines the nd glass disks each dump additional power into the beam as it passes through them after passing through a number of amplifiers the light pulse is cleaned up in a spatial filter before being fed into another series of amplifiers at each stage additional optics were used to increase the diameter of the beam and allow the use of larger and larger amplifier disks in total nova contained fifteen amplifiers and five filters of increasing size in the beamlines with an option to add an additional amplifier on the last stage although it is not clear if these were used in practice from there all ten beams pass into the experiment area at one end of the laser bay here a series of mirrors reflects the beams to impinge in the center of the bay from all angles optical devices in some of the paths slow the beams so that they all reach the center at the same time within about a picosecond  as some of the beams have longer paths to the center than others frequency multipliers upconvert the light to green and blue uv just prior to entering the target chamber nova is arranged so any remaining ir or green light is focused short of the center of the chamber the nova laser as a whole was capable of delivering approximately 100 kilojoules of infrared light at 1054 nm or 4045 kilojoules of frequency tripled light at 351 nm the third harmonic of the nd glass fundamental line at 1054 nm in a pulse duration of about 2 to 4 nanoseconds and thus was capable of producing a uv pulse in the range of 16 trillion watts research on nova was focussed on the indirect drive approach where the laser shine on the inside surface of a thin metal foil typically made of gold lead or another highz metal when heated by the laser the metal reradiates this energy as diffuse xrays which are more efficient than uv at compressing the fuel pellet in order to emit xrays the metal must be heated to very high temperatures which uses up a considerable amount of the laser energy so while the compression is more efficient the overall energy delivered to the target is nevertheless much smaller the reason for the xray conversion is not to improve energy delivery but to smooth the energy profile since the metal foil spreads out the heat somewhat the anisotropies in the original laser are greatly reduced the foil shells or hohlraums are generally formed as small openended cylinders with the laser arranged to shine in the open ends at an oblique angle in order to strike the inner surface in order to support the indirect drive research at nova a second experimental area was built past the main one opposite the laser bay the system was arranged to focus all ten beams into two sets of five each which passed into this second area and then into either end of the target chamber and from there into the hohlraums confusingly the indirect drive approach was not made widely public until 1993 documents from the era published in general science magazines and similar material either gloss over the issue or imply that nova was using the direct drive approach lacking the hohlraum it was only during the design of nif that the topic become public so nova was old news by that point as had happened with the earlier shiva nova failed to meet expectations in terms of fusion output in this case the problem was tracked to instabilities that mixed the fuel during collapse and upset the formation and transmission of the shock wave the maximum fusion yield on nova was about 1013 neutrons per shot the problem was caused by nova s inability to closely match the output energy of each of the beamlines which meant that different areas of the pellet received different amounts of heating across its surface this led to hot spots on the pellet which were imprinted into the imploding plasma seeding rayleightaylor instabilities and thereby mixing the plasma so the center did not collapse uniformly nevertheless nova remained a useful instrument even in its original form and the main target chamber and beamlines were used for many years even after it was modified as outlined below a number of different techniques for smoothing the beams were attempted over its lifetime both to improve nova as well as better understand nif these experiments added considerably not only to the understanding of icf but also to highdensity physics in general and even the evolution of the galaxy and supernovas shortly after completion of nova modifications were made to improve it as an experimental device one problem was that the experimental chamber took a long time to refit for another shot longer than the time needed to cool down the lasers in order to improve utilization of the laser a second experimental chamber was built past the original with optics that combined the ten beamlines into two nova had been built up against the older shiva buildings with the two experimental chambers back to back and the beamlines extending outward from the center target areas the two beam system was installed by passing the beamguides and related optics through the now unused shiva experimental area and placing the smaller experimental chamber in shiva s beam bay nova s partial success combined with other experimental numbers prompted department of energy to request a custom military icf facility they called the laboratory microfusion facility lmf that could achieve fusion yield between 100 and 1000 mj based on the lasnex computer models it was estimated that lmf would require a driver of about 10 mj in spite of nuclear tests that suggested a higher power building such a device was within the state of the art but would be expensive on the order of 1 billion llnl returned a design with a 5 mj 350 nm uv driver laser that would be able to reach about 200 mj yield which was enough to access the majority of the lmf goals the program was estimated to cost about 600 million fy 1989 dollars and an additional 250 million to upgrade it to a full 1000 mj if needed and would grow to well over 1 billion if lmf was to meet all of the goals the doe asked for other labs also proposed their own lmf designs using other technologies faced with this enormous project in 1989 90 national academy of sciences conducted a second review of the us icf efforts on behalf of the us congress the report concluded that considering the extrapolations required in target physics and driver performance as well as the likely 1 billion cost the committee believes that an lmf ie a laser microfusion facility with yields to one gigajoule is too large a step to take directly from the present program o their report suggested that the primary goal of the program in the short term should be resolving the various issues related to ignition and that a fullscale lmf should not be attempted until these problems were resolved the report was also critical of the gas laser experiments being carried out at lanl and suggested they and similar projects at other labs be dropped the report accepted the lasnex numbers and continued to approve an approach with laser energy around 10 mj nevertheless the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy requirements and noted indeed if it did turn out that a 100mj driver were required for ignition and gain one would have to rethink the entire approach to and rationale for icf in july 1992 llnl responded to these suggestions with the nova upgrade which would reuse the majority of the existing nova facility along with the adjacent shiva facility the resulting system would be much lower power than the lmf concept with a driver of about 1 to 2 mj the new design included a number of features that advanced the state of the art in the driver section including the multipass design in the main amplifiers and 18 beamlines up from 10 that were split into 288 beamlets as they entered the target area in order to improve the uniformity of illumination the plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines one in the existing nova beamline room and the other in the older shiva building next door extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded nova target area the lasers would deliver about 500 tw in a 4 ns pulse the upgrades were expected to allow the new nova to produce fusion yields between 2 and 20 mj the initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around 400 million with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999 for reasons that are not well recorded in the historical record later in 1992 llnl updated their nova upgrade proposal and stated that the existing nova shiva buildings would no longer be able to contain the new system and that a new building about three times as large would be needed from then on the plans evolved into the current national ignition facility starting in the late 1980s a new method of creating very short but very high power laser pulses was developed known as chirped pulse amplification or cpa starting in 1992 llnl staff modified one of nova s existing arms to build an experimental cpa laser that produced up to 125 pw known simply as petawatt it operated until 1999 when nova was dismantled to make way for nif the basic amplification system used in nova and other highpower lasers of its era was limited in terms of power density and pulse length one problem was that the amplifier glass responded over a period of time not instantaneously and very short pulses would not be strongly amplified another problem was that the high power densities led to the same sorts of selffocusing problems that had caused problems in earlier designs but at such a magnitude that even measures like spacial filtering would not be enough in fact the power densities were high enough to cause filaments to form in air cpa avoids both of these problems by spreading out the laser pulse in time it does this by reflecting a relatively multichromatic as compared to most lasers pulse off a series of two diffraction gratings which splits them spatially into different frequencies essentially the same thing a simple prism does with visible light these individual frequencies have to travel different distances when reflected back into the beamline resulting in the pulse being stretched out in time this longer pulse is fed into the amplifiers as normal which now have time to respond normally after amplification the beams are sent into a second pair of gratings in reverse to recombine them into a single short pulse with high power in order to avoid filamentation or damage to the optical elements the entire end of the beamline is placed in a large vacuum chamber although petawatt was instrumental in advancing the practical basis for the concept of fast ignition fusion by the time it was operational as a proofofconcept device the decision to move ahead with nif had already been taken further work on the fast ignition approach continues and will potentially reach a level of development far in advance of nif at hiper an experimental system under development in the european union if successful hiper should generate fusion energy over twice that of nif while requiring a laser system of less than onequarter the power and onetenth the cost fast ignition is one of the more promising approaches to fusion power when nova was being dismantled to make way for nif the target chamber was lent to france for temporary use during the development of laser megajoule a system similar to nif in many ways this loan was controversial as the only other operational laser at llnl at the time beamlet a single experimental beamline for nif  had recently been sent to sandia national laboratory in new mexico this left llnl with no large laser facility until nif started operation which was then estimated as being 2003 at the earliest work on nif was not

compound wall of the medieval fourth city of the jahanpanah in delhi with its construction credited to the reign of sultan muhammad shah tughlaq muhammad bin tughluq  13251351 of the tughlaq dynasty the objective of building the weir was for providing water for irrigation and also as a part of the city wall to provide defense security to the city against attacking armies  satpula is a usage in urdu and hindi languages which literally means seven bridges during the second decade rule of sultan muhammad shah tughlaq the economic conditions of the delhi sultanate was in distress due to very high expenses incurred on the war campaign in south india deccan and also due to the sultan establishing his southern capital at daulatabad both these acts necessitated increasing taxes to enhance the treasury coffers to meet large expenses but people were dissatisfied and distressed with these developments some tribal groups such as the chaghatai tribes had rebelled launched raids on many places in north india and even posed serious threats to delhi when the sultan was on his south indian campaign in the period between 1334 and 1344 repeated droughts had caused famines that were further compounded by the black plague these two natural calamities had added to the suffering of the people in the country urgent solutions had to be found to remedy the distress conditions one of the viable options planned was of building the satpula the seven arches bridge or gate controlled weir dam to tap the water resources of the local nallah stream feeding the yamuna river which could be used to bring large areas of flat land in the vicinity under controlled irrigated agriculture to grow food crops to stem the famine conditions this solution was also thought to provide the much needed defense to the walls of the newly built city of jahanpanah the location of the satpula which is a part of the eastwest wall protecting the southern part of jahanpanah drains a catchment comprising a series of low hills on the south east and west the stream draining the catchment area known as barapulla nallah was planned to be tapped to store the runoff water of the catchment command area for irrigation was identified in a large open plain on the northern side for providing water supplies from the proposed storage behind the satpula to grow irrigated crops to sustain a large population thus a reliable water storage reservoir in the arid region of delhi which has the thar desert on its west was built as the headworks or weir across the barapulla nallah even though no epigraphic evidence is available to date the satpula a reasseacrh study report has conjectured that it could be dated to the same time as the foureyyan mosque first of its kind in india called jami built by muhammad bin tughluq in 1343 the satpula across the stream was built as a gate controlled weir the total length of the structure is it has been constructed in stone masonry the eleven bays of the weir controlled by sluice gates cover a total length of these eleven bays consist of eleven water tunnels sluices  each in length in height and in width these are located at different levels with seven main bays at the lowest level the balance two additional bays on each bank on the far east and west sides are at a higher level the control arrangements seen now are in the form of gate grooves to operate vertical slide gates when built wooden vertical sluice gates made of heavy boards of size in thickness width and more than in height were operated by a rope and pulley arrangement to control flow of water the wooden gates have since disintegrated but the gate groves are visible in each bay the gates of the sluices were closed as a defensive measure against possible attack in the dry season when no storage remained in the dam each bay of the weir has an arched opening on both banks of the weir identical towers defensive bastions projecting on the south and north sides of diameter but with octagonal shape chambers are built which once functioned as madrasa islamic school of learning  hence the satpula is also known as madarsa the second level sluice bays on both banks lead to arched corridors the walls of the octagonal chambers have graceful decorations the stream tapped by this weir has been diverted now further east the indication of the use of the sluices of the structure either as a dam or for defense purposes could be gauged from the platforms provided at the appropriate levels silt deposition in the storage area of the reservoir side at the southern end is also seen now the archaeological survey of india asi has recently carried out restoration works of the satpula this restoration now permits access to the wide parapet of the bridge to fully view the impressive engineering structure the restoration works carried out by asi for specially identified monuments is in sync with the slogan welcome to historical city of delhi adopted by the commonwealth secretariat for the 2010 common wealth games to be held in delhi the restoration works of the satpula is at an estimated cost of rs 20 lakhs us 40000 for conservation of the monument to highlight its structural elegance by improving its overall view enhancing environmental aesthetics and its illumination satpula is located about east of khirki masjid it is close to the present city suburb of saket on the press enclave road in the medieval period it connected four principal cities namely the qila rai pithora the first city of delhi lal kot or qutub complex  siri with the siri fort forming the second city of delhi  tughlaqabad the third city of delhi and jahanpanah the fourth city of delhi the boundary limits of which encompassed the other earlier built three cities  it is locally believed that the waters stored by the weir had healing powers because the sufi saint nasiruddin mahmud is reported to have used the waters of this reservoir for daily oblations before offering prayers at the mosque  the shadow riders known as the in the original japanese language version are a fictional group of villains in the yugioh gx anime series appearing between episodes 2949 composed of seven

which compounds that are dissolved or suspended in a liquid mixture are separated from other compounds in the mixture according to their physical and chemical properties analytical laboratories use solid phase extraction to concentrate and purify samples for analysis solid phase extraction can be used to isolate analytes of interest from a wide variety of matrices including urine blood water beverages soil and animal tissue spe uses the affinity of solutes dissolved or suspended in a liquid known as the mobile phase for a solid through which the sample is passed known as the stationary phase to separate a mixture into desired and undesired components the result is that either the desired analytes of interest or undesired impurities in the sample are retained on the stationary phase the portion that passes through the stationary phase is collected or discarded depending on whether it contains the desired analytes or undesired impurities if the portion retained on the stationary phase includes the desired analytes they can then be removed from the stationary phase for collection in an additional step in which the stationary phase is rinsed with an appropriate eluent the stationary phase comes in the form of a packed syringeshaped cartridge a 96 well plate or a 47 or 90mm flat disk each of which can be mounted on its specific type of extraction manifold the manifold allows multiple samples to be processed by holding several spe media in place and allowing for an equal number of samples to pass through them simultaneously a typical cartridge spe manifold can accommodate up to 24 cartridges while a typical disk spe manifold can accommodate 6 disks most spe manifolds are equipped with a vacuum port application of vacuum speeds up the extraction process by pulling the liquid sample through the stationary phase the analytes are collected in sample tubes inside or below the manifold after they pass through the stationary phase solid phase extraction cartridges and disks are available with a variety of stationary phases each of which can separate analytes according to different chemical properties most stationary phases are based on silica that has been bonded to a specific functional group some of these functional groups include hydrocarbon chains of variable length for reversed phase spe  quaternary ammonium or amino groups for anion exchange  and sulfonic acid or carboxyl groups for cation exchange  a typical solid phase extraction involves four basic steps first the cartridge is equilibrated with a nonpolar solvent or slightly polar which wets the surface and penetrates the bonded phase then water or buffer of the same composition as the sample is typically washed through the column to wet the silica surface the sample is then added to the cartridge as the sample passes through the stationary phase the analytes in the sample will interact and retain on the sorbent while the solvent salts and other impurities pass through the cartridge after the sample is loaded the cartridge is washed with buffer or solvent to remove further impurities then the analyte is eluted with a nonpolar solvent or a buffer of the appropriate ph a stationary phase of polar functionally bonded silicas with short carbons chains frequently makes up the solid phase this stationary phase will adsorb polar molecules which can be collected with a more polar solvent reversed phase spe separates analytes based on their polarity the stationary phase of a reversed phase spe cartridge is derivatized with hydrocarbon chains which retain compounds of mid to low polarity due to the hydrophobic effect the analyte can be eluted by washing the cartridge with a nonpolar solvent which disrupts the interaction of the analyte and the stationary phase a stationary phase of silicon with carbon chains is commonly used relying on mainly nonpolar hydrophobic interactions only nonpolar or very weakly polar compounds will adsorb to the surface ion exchange sorbents separate analytes based on electrostatic interactions between the analyte of interest and the positively charged groups on the stationary phase for ion exchange to occur both the stationary phase and sample must be at a ph where both are charged anion exchange sorbents are derivatized with positively charged functional groups that interact and retain negatively charged anions such as acids strong anion exchange sorbents contain quaternary ammonium groups that have a permanent positive charge in aqueous solutions and weak anion exchange sorbents use amine groups which are charged when the ph is below about 9 strong anion exchange sorbents are useful because any strongly acidic impurities in the sample will bind to the sorbent and usually will not be eluted with the analyte of interest to recover a strong acid a weak anion exchange cartridge should be used to elute the analyte from either the strong or weak sorbent the stationary phase is washed with a solvent that neutralizes the charge of either the analyte the stationary phase or both once the charge is neutralized the electrostatic interaction between the analyte and the stationary phase no longer exists and the analyte will elute from the cartridge cation exchange sorbents are derivatized with functional groups that interact and retain positively charged cations such as bases strong cation exchange sorbents contain aliphatic sulfonic acid groups that are always negatively charged in aqueous solution and weak cation exchange sorbents contain aliphatic carboxylic acids which are charged when the ph is above about 5 strong cation exchange sorbents are useful because any strongly basic impurities in the sample will bind to the sorbent and usually will not be eluted with the analyte of interest to recover a strong base a weak cation exchange cartridge should be used to elute the analyte from either the strong or weak sorbent the stationary phase is washed with a solvent that neutralizes ionic interaction between the analyte and the stationary phase  south dunedin is a major inner city suburb of the new zealand city of dunedin it is located as its name suggests to the south of the city centre on a large plain known locally simply as the flat the suburb is a mix of industrial retail and predominantly lowerquality residential properties south dunedin s 2001 population was 2538 south dunedin is a wide area of flat land much of it reclaimed from the otago harbour this reclaimed area which lies immediately to the west of the harbour s head is known as the southern endowment and covers an area of close to the southern endowment was begun with rock removed during the cutting of bell hill in the central city during the nineteenth century this largely extended the area around the wharves close to the heart of the city but did not extend any further south until 1912 when a causeway was built along the head of the harbour as part of a otago harbour board scheme to reclaim land for industrial use dredges started to pump tailings into the area behind the causeway in the 1940s reclamation continued for many years and was not officially completed until the opening of portsmouth drive which runs along the route of the 1912 causeway at the harbour edge in 1978 most of the area of the southern endowment is industrial and storage though it does contain a small part close to the wharf area and the major sports complex of the edgar centre close to its southern edge south dunedin contains the city s second most important retail district centred on cargill s corner named for otago provincial founder captain william cargill hillside road at one time called cargill road is named for his house hillside which lay some to the north  at this junction two main suburban arterial routes king edward street and hillside road cross a small shopping mall south city is located at cargill s corner cargill s corner had for many years dunedin s only barnes dance pedestrian crossing its use was phased out during the 1980s king edward street is aligned roughly northsouth linking with the southern end of princes street and the centre city in the north with the densely populated coastal suburb of saint kilda hillside road links andersons bay road a further major suburban arterial in the east with the suburbs of caversham corstorphine and saint clair in the west and southwest smaller older shops stretch south along king edward street and west along hillside road from cargill s corner to the east along hillside road and anderson s bay road are larger supermarkets and wholesalers notably pakn save the warehouse and mitre 10 mega further along anderson s bay road to the south and to the west on hillside road are numerous car sale yards and light industrial works these extend into caversham in the west and across the reclaimed land which lies between andersons bay road and portsmouth drive in the south and east at its southern extreme king edward street becomes increasingly residential though there are also light industrial premises here andersons bay road lies roughly parallel with king edward street some to the east this route which roughly follows the original shoreline connects with state highway 1 and dunedin s oneway street system in the north and with the suburb of musselburgh in the south it also provides a major route from the centre city with otago peninsula portsmouth drive a further arterial route lies a further to the east this route links the centre city with portobello road the long twisting route which travels the length of otago peninsula s harbour coast it is named for dunedin s american sister city of portsmouth virginia other important roads in south dunedin include timaru street on the southern endowment and several streets which cross or meet king edward street linking it with anderson s bay road in the east or the suburbs of saint clair and forbury in the west these include macandrew road melbourne street mcbride street and bay view road the latter of which forms the boundary between south dunedin and saint kilda the industrial heart of south dunedin is the hillside railway workshops located immediately to the west of cargills corner these workshops cover some and stretch into the neighbouring suburb of caversham other notable buildings in south dunedin include the mayfair theatre close to cargill s corner and the edgar sports centre at the southeastern extremity of the suburb on portsmouth drive the city s main sports complex carisbrook is located close to the border of south dunedin in caversham a former stadium the caledonian ground stood on ground now largely occupied by the warehouse retail store it was relocated in 2000 to logan park in dunedin north the junction of andersons bay road and hillside road located nearby is still sometimes referred to as caledonian corner this corner is also the former site of the country s longestserving gasworks which operated from 1863 to 1987 and a small industrial museum the dunedin gasworks museum is located on the southern part of its site on braemar street opened to the public in 2001 this museum is one of only three known preserved gasworks museums in the world the museum features five steam pumping engines which were used in the gasworks and an older engine imported from scotland in 1868 there are several notable churches in south dunedin among them the city s only eastern orthodox church st michael s in fingall street and st patrick s roman catholic basilica designed by francis petre in macandrew road other than the hillside workshops and the gasworks south dunedin has several links with dunedin s industrial heritage notable among these was the factory of g methven one of new zealand s leading bathroom fittings manufacturers this company founded by george methven was located for many years in andersons bay road on a site now occupied by a mitre 10 megastore another former landmark in south dunedin was the former caledonian sports ground this was located opposite the gasworks at the corner of hillside road and andersons bay road a site still known as the caledonian corner the sports field was relocated to dunedin north and the site is now the car park of the warehouse all that remains of the original sports complex is a lawn bowls club and the gymnasium which is also south dunedin s main war memorial hillside workshops have their own separate memorial by the site s main gate  the northeastern edge of the suburb closest to the city centre is the smaller suburb of kensington kensington is located on and around king edward street at the foot of a spur of maryhill officially referred to as montecillo ridge and close to the inner city sports ground the oval this ground originally called the southern recreation ground is often referred to as the kensington oval so as to distinguish it from the university oval in the north of the city this ground is actually triangular but at one time contained a separate oval cricket ground which gave it its name dunedin southern cemetery sits on the slope of montecillo ridge immediately above kensington separated from it by south road a main route to caversham which joins with princes street close to the oval these two green areas mark the southernmost extreme of dunedin s town belt which sweeps around the central city in a broad crescent through the suburbs of mornington belleknowes roslyn maori hill woodhaugh and dunedin north the lower slopes of montecillo ridge were at one time the site of hillside the home of dunedin city s founding father captain william cargill though the house is long gone its name lives on in that of south dunedin s hillside road kensington is largely separated from south dunedin by an overbridge carrying the south island main trunk railway the longclosed kensington railway halt was located immediately to the east of the bridge and accessed by a flight of stairs in one of the bridge s supports long since sealed up a newer flyover 200 metres to the north carries state highway 1 through kensington though there are no slip roads connecting the suburb with the highway this flyover separates kensington into two distinct parts a light industrial zone to the south of the flyover and a residential zone to the north at the foot of the ridge a notable feature of kensington is the city s army drill hall located in bridgman street immediately to the south of state highway 1  in telecommunications squelch is a circuit function that acts to suppress the audio or video output of a receiver in the absence of a sufficiently strong desired input signal squelch excludes undesired lowerpower input signals that may be present at or near the frequency of the desired signal squelch is a noise gate that only allows signals at a specified strength over a threshold to be played through the speaker as an example general static with no transmission is squelched out  contrast with noise suppression  a carrier squelch or noise squelch is the most simple variant of all it operates strictly on the signal strength such as when a television mutes the audio or blanks the video on empty channels or when a walkie talkie mutes the audio when no signal is present in some designs the squelch threshold is preset for example television squelch settings are usually preset receivers in base stations at remote mountain top sites are usually not adjustable remotely from the control point in devices such as radiotelephones also known as twoway radios  the squelch can be adjusted with a knob others have push buttons or a sequence of button presses this setting adjusts the threshold at which signals will open unmute the audio channel backing off the control will turn on the audio and the operator will hear white noise also called squelch noise if there is no signal present the usual operation is to adjust the control until the channel just shuts off then only a small threshold signal is needed to turn on the speaker however if a weak signal is annoying the operator can adjust the squelch to open only when stronger signals are received if you hold the squelch open you will also get a lot of noise a typical fm twoway radio carrier squelch circuit takes out the voice components of the receive audio by passing the detected audio through a highpass filter a typical filter might pass frequencies over 4000 hz 4 khz  the squelch control adjusts the gain of an amplifier which varies the level of noise coming out of the filter the audio output of the filter and amplifier is rectified and produces a dc voltage when noise is present the presence of noise creates a dc voltage which turns the receiver audio off when a signal with little or no noise is received the voltage goes away and the receiver audio is unmuted some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio muting control voltage as a signal present indication tone squelch or other forms of selective calling are sometimes used to solve interference problems where more than one user is on the same channel cochannel users  selective calling addresses a subset of all receivers instead of turning on the receive audio for any signal the audio turns on only in the presence of the correct selective calling code this is akin to the use of a lock on a door a carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in selective calling locks out all signals except ones with the correct code in noncritical uses selective calling can also be used to hide the presence of interfering signals such as receiverproduced intermodulation receivers with poor specifications such as scanners or lowcost mobile radios cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments the interference will still be present it will still degrade system performance but by using selective calling the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference four different techniques are commonly used selective calling can be regarded as a form of inband signaling ctcss continuous tonecoded squelch system continuously superimposes any one of about 50 lowpitch audio tones on the transmitted signal ranging from 67 to 254 hz the original tone set was 32 tones and has been expanded over the years ctcss is often called pl tone for private line a trademark of motorola  or simply tone squelch general electric s implementation of ctcss is called channel guard or cg  rca corporation used the name quiet channel or qc there are many other companyspecific names used by radio vendors to describe compatible options any ctcss system that has compatible tones is interchangeable old and new radios with ctcss and radios across manufacturers are compatible selcall selective calling transmits a burst of five inband audio tones at the beginning of each transmission this feature sometimes called tone burst is common in european systems in the same way that a single ctcss tone would be used on an entire group of radios a single fivetone sequence is used in a group of radios dcs digitalcoded squelch superimposes a continuous stream of fsk digital data at 1344 bits per second on the transmitted signal in the same way that a single ctcss tone would be used on an entire group of radios the same dcs code is used in a group of radios dcs is also referred to as digital private line or dpl  another trademark of motorola and likewise general electric s implementation of dcs is referred to a digital channel guard or dcg  dcs is also called dtcs digital tone code squelch by icom and other names by other manufacturers radios with dcs options are generally compatible provided the radio s encoderdecoder will use the same code as radios in the existing system be aware that the same 23bit dcs word can for example produce three different valid dcs codes xtcss is the newest signaling technique and it provides 99 codes with the added advantage of silent operation  xtcss fitted radios are purposed to enjoy more privacy and flexibility of operation xtcss is implemented as a combination of ctcss and inband signalling carrier squelch was invented first and is still in wide use in twoway radio especially in the amateur radio world squelch of any kind is used to indicate loss of signal which is used to keep commercial and amateur radio repeaters from transmitting continually since a carrier squelch receiver cannot tell a valid carrier from a spurious signal noise etc ctcss is often used as well as it avoids false keyups use of ctcss is especially helpful on bands prone to skip and during band openings family radio service frs and pmr446 radios often use a number of different ctcss tones usually erroneously called subchannels the actual number of tones depends on the manufacturer  while these do not add to the available number of conversations which can take place at once in a given area they do reduce annoying interference experienced by users however they do not afford any protection from eavesdropping as the voice signal is not encrypted the squelch system relies on the receiver to comply with the squelch signal but if a receiver chooses to listen in the signal is not protected it is a bad idea to use any coded squelch system to hide interference issues in systems with lifesafety or publicsafety uses such as police fire search and rescue or ambulance company dispatching adding tone or digital squelch to a radio system does nt solve interference issues it just covers them up the presence of interfering signals should be corrected rather than masked interfering signals masked by tone squelch will produce apparently random missed messages the intermittent nature of interfering signals will make the problem difficult to reproduce and troubleshoot users will not understand why they cannot hear a call and will lose confidence in their radio system professional wireless microphones use squelch to avoid reproducing noise when the receiver does not receive enough signal from the microphone most professional models have adjustable squelch usually set with a screwdriver adjustment on the receiver  summer shaw is a fictional character from the longrunning channel 4 soap opera hollyoaks played by summer strallen the character is most notable for being planted in the show as publicity for an andrew lloyd webber produced stage production of the sound of music making national headlines summer the fictional character won the same leading role of maria that strallen had been cast as in the west end show summer arrives as an undergraduate at hollyoaks community college who has moved to chester and who seems to have an interfering mother constantly phoning her to check if she is okay john paul and katy spot her conversing with her mother on the phone and realise a pair of underwear has dropped from her suitcase as she gathers her bags and walks off to find the admissions office john paul screams for her but she does not hear him later while dining at il gnosh the two spot her again where john paul timidly returns the pair of underwear to her and introduces himself the two strike up a friendship and while walking through the college she talks lots about herself and her passion for the performing arts john paul invites her for a drink which katy does not join them probably as she finds her a bit full on while john paul strikes up a conversation with jay summer befriends russ while sitting at the bar while attending john paul s housewarming party at the halls summer caught the eye of kris fisher the carbon monoxide leak from the faulty boiler rendered her unconscious along with all the other people in the party summer was drowsy but recovered at the scene she was given the all clear by doctors and was told to go home at a swimming pool in which ob had taken tom to teach him how to swim ob saw summer and started chatting her up he was so busy talking to her that he did nt notice tom taking his armbands off before jumping in and having to be saved by simon crosby summer then started working at mobs where it was obvious that ob had a crush on her and she clashed with max cunningham s girlfriend steph dean who she worked with and originally met after they both went for a part to star in a health and safety video after running into nancy hayton and sarah barnes the trio decided to go for a drink when a guy walked into the su bar when sarah said ooh i d have a bit of that where nancy replied no he s not my type before summer noticed him and called out james nancy and sarah both looked horrified by what they said james summer s longterm boyfriend is in the army and tells summer he s on leave because he is to spend five months in afghanistan and he leaves the next day summer considered asking him to stay before a hearttoheart with sarah who asked her what if you landed a part in a broadway show i d ask him to come with me o for him to drop everything to follow your dreams when you would nt let him follow his summer understood that she could nt have it all her way and let him go after telling him if you get yourself killed out there i ll murder you you say that everytime the pair kiss and james left in a taxi on the 15th november 2007 summer received a phone call from james after the credits had ended she was crying and told ob that it was over between her and james she ran off leaving ob alone at the dog in the pond summer recently shared a kiss with kris fisher after their radio show was taken over by pirates aka john paul mcqueen and elliot bevan but then it was revealed that they are a couple when she tells ob i never would have thought i would have a boyfriend who looked better than me in lipgloss however after realising her feelings for ob she breaks up with kris claiming he is too high maintenance this results in quite a nasty argument between them kris calling summer shallow while summer stated that crossdressing did nt make him any more special and that he wakes up in the morning and thinks who shall i be today male or female  later kris sees summer having lunch with ob and is angry but when ob defends her kris and ob fight  ending in summer pouring water over them on 25 january 2008 after steph suggested that they should form a band summer decided she d had enough of life in hollyoaks and wanted to try her luck at living in london she wanted to be able to chase her dreams and not wait for the opportunities to come to her she asked ob to go with her but he refused saying that he could nt let max down by leaving after one last ditch attempt to convince ob to come with her she walked out the door later max convinced ob to leave with summer saying that she is the best thing that s ever happened to him they race to the bus station in the mobs van arriving just as the bus is about to leave ob hopped on the bus and tells summer that she only asked him twice to leave and everyone knows that it s three times for luck after a hug and a kiss they departed for london with max looking on after arriving in london summer sets about trying to find andrew lloyd webber so that she can try to get a part in one of his plays on 1 february 2008 despite her nerves during an audition summer has successfully been offered a part of maria in the sound of music one of andrew lloyd webber s plays on 15 february 2008 summer made her exit from hollyoaks leading a new life to star in one of andrew lloyd webber s plays but with b s second thoughts about moving out summer realises she has to start a new life alone even without him on 28 february 2008 ob chased his dream and him and summer got back together with him remaining in london with her to start their new life the last time her being seen onscreen  the tabuk sniper rifle is an iraqi modification of a serbian designated marksman s rifle made from as a modified version of the zastava m70 assault rifle the tabuk sniper rifle like all the ak47 and dragunov svd derivatives made in iraq was manufactured at the alqadissiya establishments using machineries sold to iraq with the power at the time still firmly in the hands of saddam hussein by zastava of yugoslavia zastava of yugoslavia originally developed this rifle from its experience in making its m70 rifles a variant of the akm with some minor differences from the original  particularly the m76 all of the rifles in the m70 series share what is traditionally considered an rpk style receiver that is the receiver is made with a thicker gauge of sheet metal formed over a larger and heavier trunion while this does add to weight it has a positive effect on durability which is why the modification came about for the russian rpk  the yugoslavian rpk or m72 is the longer barreled member of the m70 family and is the weapons upon which the tabuk is based the tabuk rifle unlike the yugoslavian rpk has a 245 barrel including flash hider the actual barrel length is closer to 214 slightly shorter than a soviet rpk but much longer than a traditional akm or the m70 1625  the tabuk like the rpk has a provision for muzzle attachments in the typical russian thread pattern of 14x1mm left hand thread which means that it can accept several variations of soviet flash hiders and muzzle brakes as well as soviet designed sound suppression devices after incidents in baghdad in the summer of 2005 initial media descriptions of the tabuk rifle were misspelled in many media reports as tobuk or tobok tabook tabouk the latter two spellings are more correct transliterations of the arabic øªø¨ùˆùƒ is a common place name in the arab world as it was the site of an historically significant battle during the lifetime of the muslim prophet mohammed the most common association is probably the capitol city of the saudi province of the same name saudi arabia maps county detail provinces in many of these reports the tabuk rifle is described incorrectly as being based on the svd dragunov unlike the kalashnikov ak47 and ak74 rifles which fire 7 62x39mm and 5 45x39mm rounds respectively the dragunov and its variants chamber the older 7 62x54mmr cartridge adopted by the russian army in 1891 by way of the mosinnagant 1891 rifle that in various forms was used through the end of world war ii and beyond this would be an easy mistake to make as the furniture of the tabuk looks much like the dragunov and has a longer barrel like that of the latter rifle s 620 mm 244 inches the differences between the tabuk and the yugo rpk are in fact few the semi auto only internals included with the tabuk is a visually unobvious difference but perhaps the most important it is this feature that dictates the rifles role as one of precision fire and not suppressive fire it is also important as it prevents relatively untrained individuals from subjecting the barrel of a rifle intended for precision to fulalto fire as such would only act to shorten said rifle s useful life a more distinguishing difference and perhaps the most important visual cue is the fact that the rpk s barrel is finned at the rear near the hand guards and far heavier than a standard akm or for that matter the tabuk  the weight thickness of the rpk s barrel exists to facilitate heat distribution via mass and cooling via surface area since the option to fire full auto has been omitted and it is not typical of eastern block long range precision rifles to use heavy barrels for accuracy the tabuk like the svd and the psl has a relatively light barrel the tabuk differs from the m72 in some other ways it has the provision for mounting optics for one though this is not an unusual accessory on eastern bloc weapons and it has a skeletonized buttstock with a cheek piece a third difference and perhaps the most important though not definitive visual cue when identifying the tabuk is the conspicuous lack of a bipod the bipod which is not detachable from the m72 though sometimes removed by undisciplined troops  is quite obvious from afar when attached it was likely removed to enhance mechanical accuracy and reduce weight though if it were left attached it may have added stability practical accuracy for long range work as it is essentially an accurized scoped rpk the tabuk is subsequently chambered in the rpk s primary caliber 762x39 this is advantageous as it allows the tabuk to use the same magazines as the ak47 and ak47 magazines are well made plentiful and easy to replace if lost because the tabuk it is chambered in the soviet m43 or 7 62x39mm cartridge it cannot technically function as a sniper rifle by western standards  with a maximum effective range of only 600m based on trajectory  the tabuk should instead be considered a designated marksman s rifle that said and considering the terrain upon which these rifles are typically fielded urban  this quibble is purely semantics the tabuk is within its given range every bit as effective as the dragunov or psl if used precisely however from the point of terminal ballistics the soviet 7 62x39mm is too stable in tissue at the far end of its effective range it is decidedly less lethal than its higher velocity counterparts due to the round s combination of stability and low velocity giving it less reach than the 7 62x54r caliber svd it visually resembles an rpk which may make identifying enemy snipers designated marks men more difficult likewise its acoustic signature mimics that of an ak47 being chambered for a relatively low velocity intermediate round the tabuk has poor barrier penetration and performance against body armor compared to weapons chambered for fullpowered cartridges like 7 62x51 or 762x54r  was a daimyo in the sengoku period who unified the political factions of japan he succeeded his former liege lord oda nobunaga and brought an end to the sengoku period the period of his rule is often called the momoyama period named after hideyoshi s castle he is noted for a number of cultural legacies including the restriction that only members of the samurai class could bear arms hideyoshi is regarded as japan s second great unifier very little is known for certain about hideyoshi before 1570 when he begins to appear in surviving documents and letters his autobiography starts in 1577 but in it hideyoshi spoke very little about his past by tradition he was born in what is now nakamuraku nagoya situated in modernday aichi district owari province  the home of the oda clan he was born of no traceable samurai lineage being the son of a peasantwarrior named yaemon he had no surname and his childhood given name was bounty of the sun although variations exist toyotomi hideyoshi had been given the nickname kozaru meaning little monkey from his lord oda nobunaga because his facial features and skinny form resembled that of a monkey he was also known as the bald rat many legends describe hideyoshi being sent to study at a temple as a young man but he rejected temple life and went in search of adventure under the name he first joined the imagawa clan as a servant to a local ruler named matsushita yukitsuna he traveled all the way to the lands of imagawa yoshimoto daimyo of suruga province and served there for a time only to abscond with a sum of money entrusted to him by matsushita yukitsuna around 1547 he returned to owari province and joined the oda clan now headed by oda nobunaga as a lowly servant he became one of nobunaga s sandalbearers and was present at the battle of okehazama in 1560 when nobunaga defeated imagawa yoshimoto to become one of the most powerful warlords in the sengoku period according to his biographers he supervised the repair of kiyosu castle a claim described as apocryphal and managed the kitchen in 1561 hideyoshi married nene who was asano nagamasa s adopted daughter he carried out repairs on sunomata castle with his younger brother toyotomi hidenaga and the bandits hachisuka masakatsu and maeno nagayasu hideyoshi s efforts were well received because sunomata was in enemy territory he constructed a fort in sunomata according to legend overnight and discovered a secret route into mount inaba after which much of the garrison surrendered hideyoshi was very successful as a negotiator in 1564 he managed to convince mostly with liberal bribes a number of mino warlords to desert the saito clan hideyoshi approached many saito clan samurai and convinced them to submit to nobunaga including the saito clan s strategist takenaka hanbei nobunaga s easy victory at inabayama castle in 1567 was largely due to hideyoshi s efforts and despite his peasant origins hideyoshi became one of nobunaga s most distinguished generals eventually taking the name hashiba hideyoshi   the new surname included two characters one each from oda s two other righthand men niwa nagahide and shibata katsuie hideyoshi led troops in the battle of anegawa in 1570 in which oda nobunaga allied with future rival tokugawa ieyasu who would eventually displace hideyoshi s son and rule japan to lay siege to two fortresses of the azai and asakura clans in 1573 after victorious campaigns against the azai and asakura nobunaga appointed hideyoshi daimyo of three districts in the northern part of omi province initially based at the former azai headquarters in odani hideyoshi moved to kunitomo and renamed the city nagahama in tribute to nobunaga hideyoshi later moved to the port at imahama on lake biwa from there he began work on imahama castle and took control of the nearby kunitomo firearms factory that had been established some years previously by the azai and asakura under hideyoshi s administration the factory s output of firearms increased dramatically nobunaga sent hideyoshi to himeji castle to conquer chugoku region in 1576 after the assassinations at honnoji of oda nobunaga and his eldest son nobutada in 1582 at the hands of akechi mitsuhide hideyoshi defeated akechi at the battle of yamazaki at a meeting at kiyosu to decide on a successor to nobunaga hideyoshi cast aside the apparent candidate oda nobutaka and his advocate oda clan s chief general shibata katsuie by supporting nobutada s young son oda hidenobu having won the support of the other two oda elders niwa nagahide and ikeda tsuneoki hideyoshi established hidenobu s position as well as his own influence in the oda clan tension quickly escalated between hideyoshi and katsuie and at the battle of shizugatake in the following year hideyoshi destroyed katsuie s forces and thus consolidated his own power absorbing most of the oda clan into his control in 1583 hideyoshi began construction of osaka castle built on the site of the temple ishiyama honganji destroyed by nobunaga the castle would become the last stronghold of the toyotomi clan after hideyoshi s death nobunaga s other son oda nobukatsu remained hostile to hideyoshi he allied himself with tokugawa ieyasu and the two sides fought at the inconclusive battle of komaki and nagakute it ultimately resulted in a stalemate although hideyoshi s forces were delivered a heavy blow  finally hideyoshi made peace with nobukatsu ending the pretext for war between the tokugawa and hashiba clans hideyoshi sent tokugawa ieyasu his younger sister asahi no kata and mother omandokoro  as hostages ieyasu eventually agreed to become a vassal of hideyoshi like nobunaga before him hideyoshi never achieved the title of shogun instead he arranged to have himself adopted into the fujiwara regents house and secured a succession of high imperial court titles including in 1585 the prestigious position of regent kampaku  in 1586 hideyoshi was formally given the name toyotomi by the imperial court he built a lavish palace the jurakudai in 1587 and entertained the reigning emperor goyozei the following year afterwards hideyoshi subjugated kii province and conquered shikoku under the chosokabe clan he also took control of etchu province and conquered kyushu in 1587 hideyoshi banished christian missionaries from kyushu to exert greater control over the kirishitan daimyo however since he made much of trade with europeans individual christians were overlooked unofficially in 1588 hideyoshi forbade ordinary peasants from owning weapons and started a sword hunt to confiscate arms the swords were melted down to create a statue of the buddha this measure effectively stopped peasant revolts and ensured greater stability at the expense of freedom of the individual daimyo the 1590 siege of odawara against the late hojo clan in kanto eliminated the last resistance to hideyoshi s authority his victory signified the end of the sengoku period during this siege hideyoshi proposed that ieyasu currently controlled five provinces were submitted and ieyasu receive the eight kanto provinces that kitajo ruled ieyasu accepted this proposal and date masamune pledged loyalty to the hideyoshi in february 1591 hideyoshi ordered sen no rikyu to commit suicide rikyu had been a trusted retainer and master of the tea ceremony under both hideyoshi and nobunaga under hideyoshi s patronage rikyu made significant changes to the aesthetics of the tea ceremony that had lasting influence over many aspects of japanese culture even after he ordered rikyu s suicide hideyoshi is said to have built his many construction projects based upon principles of beauty promoted by rikyu following rikyu s death hideyoshi turned his attentions from tea ceremony to noh which he had been studying in the komparu style since becoming kampaku during his brief stay in nagoya castle in what is today saga prefecture on kyushu hideyoshi memorized the shite lead roles parts of ten noh plays which he then performed forcing various daimyo to accompany him onstage as the waki secondary accompanying role  he even performed before the emperor the stability of the toyotomi dynasty after hideyoshi s death was put in doubt with the death of his only son tsurumatsu in september 1591 the threeyearold was his only child when his halfbrother hidenaga died shortly after his son hideyoshi named his nephew hidetsugu his heir adopting him in january 1592 hideyoshi resigned as kampaku to take the title of taiko retired regent  hidetsugu succeeded him as kampaku his health beginning to falter but still yearning for some accomplishment to solidify his legacy hideyoshi adopted the dream of a japanese conquest of china that oda nobunaga had contemplated and launched two illfated invasions of korea though he actually intended to conquer ming china hideyoshi had been communicating with the koreans since 1587 requesting unmolested passage into china as allies of ming china the koreans at first refused talks entirely and in april and july 1591 refused demands that japanese troops be allowed to march through korea the koreans were also concerned that allowing japanese troops to march through korea chosun would mean that masses of ming chinese troops would battle hideyoshi s troops on korean soil before they could reach chinaeffectively ruining the chosun economy the sad reality was that the koreans faced a catch22 because refusing safe passage for the japanese troops would lead to a japanese attack in august hideyoshi ordered preparations for invasion in the first campaign hideyoshi appointed ukita hideie to the field marshal and had them go to the korean peninsula in april 1592 konishi yukinaga occupied seoul the capital of the joseon dynasty on may 10 and in only four months hideyoshi s forces had a route into manchuria and occupied much of korea korean king seonjo of joseon escaped to pyongyang and requested military intervention from china in 1593 ming chinese emperor wanli sent an army under general li rusong to block the planned invasion of china and recapture the korean peninsula li recaptured pyongyang and surrounded seoul ishida mitsunari massed japanese forces in seoul and halted li rusong and his forces with a serious counterattack the war reached a deadlock and after the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement japanese troops retreated to japan the birth of hideyoshi s second son hideyori in 1593 created a potential succession problem to avoid it hideyoshi exiled his nephew and heir hidetsugu to mount koya and then ordered him to commit suicide in august 1595 hidetsugu s family members who did not follow his example were then murdered in kyoto including 31 women and several children on february 5 1597 toyotomi hideyoshi had twentysix christians killed as an example to japanese who wanted to convert to christianity they are known as the twentysix martyrs of japan they included five european franciscan missionaries one mexican franciscan missionary three japanese jesuits and seventeen japanese laymen including three young boys they were executed by public crucifixion in nagasaki after several years of negotiations broken off because envoys of both sides falsely reported to their masters that the opposition surrendered  hideyoshi appointed kobayakawa hideaki to lead the invasion forces but their efforts on the korean peninsula met with less success than the first invasion japanese troops remained pinned in gyeongsang province by june 1598 the japanese forces fought with desperation turning back several chinese offensives in suncheon and sacheon as the ming army prepared for a final assault the koreans guerrilla warfare aided by the fact that they were fighting on their homeland continually harassed japanese forces while hideyoshi s last battle at sochon was a major japanese victory all three parties to the war were exhausted and hideyoshi himself now accepted that the war could not be won he told his commander in korea do nt let my soldiers become spirits in a foreign land  toyotomi hideyoshi died in august 18 1598 his death was kept secret by the council of five elders to preserve morale and japanese troops were withdrawn from the korean peninsula because of his failure to capture korea hideyoshi s forces were unable to invade china rather than strengthen his position the military expeditions left his clan s coffers and fighting strength depleted his vassals at odds over responsibility for the failure and the clans that were loyal to the toyotomi name weakened the dream of a japanese empire encompassing asia ended with hideyoshi the tokugawa government not only prohibited any military expeditions to the mainland but closed japan to nearly all foreigners during the years of the tokugawa shogunate it was not until the late 19th century that japan would again fight a war against china through korea using much the same route that hideyoshi s invasion force had used after his death the other members of the council of five regents were unable to keep the ambitions of tokugawa ieyasu in check two of hideyoshi s top generals kato kiyomasa and fukushima masanori had fought bravely during the war but returned to find the toyotomi clan castellan ishida mitsunari in power he held the generals in low esteem and they sided with tokugawa ieyasu hideyoshi s underaged son and designated successor hideyori lost the power his father once held and tokugawa ieyasu was declared shogun following the battle of sekigahara toyotomi hideyoshi changed japanese society in many ways these include imposition of a rigid class structure restriction on travel and surveys of land and production class reforms affected commoners and warriors during the sengoku period it had become common for peasants to become warriors or for samurai to farm due to the constant uncertainty caused by the lack of centralized government and always tentative peace upon taking control hideyoshi decreed that all peasants be disarmed completely conversely he required samurai to leave the land and take up residence in the castle towns this solidified the social class system for the next 300 years furthermore he ordered comprehensive surveys and a complete census of japan once this was done and all citizens were registered he required all japanese to stay in their respective han fiefs unless they obtained official permission to go elsewhere this ensured order in a period when bandits still roamed the countryside and peace was still new the land surveys formed the basis for systematic taxation in 1590 hideyoshi completed construction of the osaka castle the largest and most formidable in all japan to guard the western approaches to kyoto in that same year hideyoshi banned unfree labor or slavery but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes forced labor hideyoshi also influenced the material culture of japan he lavished time and money on the tea ceremony collecting implements sponsoring lavish social events and patronizing acclaimed masters as interest in the tea ceremony rose among the ruling class so too did demand for fine ceramic implements and during the course of the korean campaigns not only were large quantities of prized ceramic ware confiscated many korean artisans were forcibly relocated to japan inspired by the dazzling golden pavilion in kyoto he also constructed a fabulous portable tea room covered with gold leaf and lined inside with red gossamer using this mobile innovation he was able to practice the tea ceremony wherever he went powerfully projecting his unrivaled power and status upon his arrival politically he set up a governmental system that balanced out the most powerful japanese warlords or daimyo  a council was created to include the most influential lords at the same time a regent was designated to be in command just prior to his death hideyoshi hoped to set up a system stable enough to survive until his son grew old enough to become the next leader a was formed consisting of the five most powerful daimyo following the death of maeda toshiie however tokugawa ieyasu began to secure alliances including political marriages which had been forbidden by hideyoshi  eventually the protoyotomi forces fought against the tokugawa in the battle of sekigahara ieyasu won and received the title of seiitai shogun two years later hideyoshi is commemorated at several toyokuni shrines scattered over japan ieyasu left in place the majority of hideyoshi s decrees and built his shogunate upon them this ensured that hideyoshi s cultural legacy remained in a letter to his wife hideyoshi wrote because of his low birth and high nobility toyotomi hideyoshi had quite a few names throughout his life at birth he was given the name hiyoshimaru at genpuku he took the name later he was given the surname hashiba and the honorary court office chikuzen no kami as a result he was styled his surname remained hashiba even as he was granted the new uji or sei or clan name toyotomi by the emperor his name is correctly toyotomi no hideyoshi using the writing system of his time his name is written as  the toyotomi uji was simultaneously granted to a number of hideyoshi s chosen allies who adopted the new uji toyotomi no asomi courtier of toyotomi  the catholic sources of the time referred to him as emperor taicosama from taiko a retired kampaku see sessho and kampaku  and the honorific sama  his nickname was monkey saru  allegedly given by oda nobunaga because of his facial resemblance to a monkey this recognition directly contributed to the popular image of toyotomi hideyoshi being a monkey styled person both in appearance and mode of behaviour  wakr is an am radio station in akron ohio usa operating on 1590 khz it is owned by rubber city radio group inc which also owns akron s wonefm

seal chuck pfarrer from the start of his career to his last mission he writes in an honest way although some areas are not specific in which he cites that he cannot reveal that much due to continued secrecy this memoir is praised by the new york times bookseller as the best memoir of a former seal chuck pfarrer writes about his career beginning with a story of his last mission with seal team 6 disguised as regular people the team meets up at norfolk international airport to prepare to board an american airlines boeing 727 for a flight to a unknown destination it is actually a test mission for military air traffic control in the norfolk virginia area to see if they can detect a free falling seal team and the american airlines plane is actually being flown by a seal that s certified in flying aircraft the 727 takes off and flies towards florida as a disguised as any regular flight when it suddenly banks back to norfolk switches its identity to a military aircraft and request the norfolk air traffic control tower to do a touch and go approach to the airport while this is happening chuck and his team are gearing up with all of their gear seal s practiced in full combat gear regardless of the situation given according to chuck and prepared to jump out of the back door of the 727 when the 727 begins descending team gets the signal to jump they all jump out of the 727 descending towards the ground not opening parachutes at a certain height the team slowly open their parachutes while for chuck however the situation is grave he cannot open his parachute for a particular reason and now the ground is approaching closely as he passes his team falling towards the ground chuck makes a quick decision in thirty seconds and uses an emergency cord to open his reserve chute which it successfully opens at the cost of losing two of his fingernails from ripping at the chord he lands on the ground near demonstration beach and is knocked out but he slowly gets up and laughs off his situation chuck then goes to tell about his life in the beginning he was born in boston massachusetts and was the son of charles pfarrer a us navy officer and joan marie a nurse and was a brother chuck was baptized as a roman catholic saying although my family is not the religious type we still ate fish sticks on fridays i came to accept the saint s and teachings in my early life  the family moved around to many places including rhode island hawaii and mississippi when he was 12 the family moves down to biloxi mississippi and chuck s father leaves them for deployment in vietnam while chuck s father was participating in the vietnam war the family home in biloxi is destroyed by hurricane camille thus making chuck angry at god for the destruction and giving up his religious faith sometime later his father comes home and the family moves to rhode island where chuck begins to secretly skipping school to go surfing he actually began doing the sport when the family was in hawaii  he describes how he was passionate about the sport adopting the surfer dude look how rebellious he became unknowingly to his family and how he skipped school just to go surfing he would head directly to the beach to go surfing and as the school bus came home he made an excuse to his that he took a shower during pe  eventually his parents found out about his exploits when the school dean called them to say that chuck had low grades in his school chuck s father soon gives him a choice of which military school to go to hoping to discipline his son chuck chooses to go to staunton military academy not knowing that he did because he was bored he had chosen the toughest military academy at that time to attend arriving at the academy chuck is then bullied by various cadets who call him a hippie and other derogative terms due to his surfing looks he is forced to get rid of it to adapt to the discipline of the academy although chuck does not get in much depth of his life at staunton he describes the general life there he describes how the rigorous lifestyle made him more organized and disciplined but he also describes fellow cadets there chuck mentions that his fellow cadets were bastards of hollywood stars sons dictators senators juvenile delinquents and fortune 500 ceo s all whom had a diverse skill chuck talks about how this core group taught him skills that would prove useful later on in his seal career he learned how to pick locks of car doors how to unofficially leave the academy grounds without permission to go to town and how to hide contraband he graduates from the academy with a scholarship offer from annapolis but rejects it to go attend csu northridge disappointing his father at csu northridge chuck studies to major in psychology managing his time well regularly earning high grades hoping one day to become a psychologist there he meets his first girlfriend and they both travel to england to studyat the university of bath it is there where his relationship falls apart and chuck returns to california to become an intern at an unknown psychology he realizes how boring life was and finds a sudden desire to becomea navy seal one day he walks into a naval recruiting office and says to the recruiter that he wants to become a navy seal not before abruptly quitting his job at the psychology office the recruiter then questions how he knew what the seal s were this was before the seal s were known in the media and chuck describes how his father knew them in vietnam when he was there the recruiter declines him a slot to chuck s disappointment but chuck strikes him a deal if he can get a slot he will have to attend officer candidate school ocs before getting to attend bud s if he dor s drop on request or washed out then he would become a green beret the recruiter agrees and chuck heads back to rhode island to prepare for ocs he sees his exgirlfriend for the last time before shipping out to attend the school after a couple of months in ocs he graduates commissioned as a lieutenant right after ocs chuck heads to coronado california to prepare for bud s he is given a slot in class 114 where there is little time to prepare for bud s during and in the early post vietnam era there was no indoctration period  class 114 begins its first day by getting hammered by the instructors almost all who were vietnam war veterans again chuck just describes the general life there he describes the physical training the class has to do to the numerous men who drop out to how the instructors punish or simply goof off with the students to test their minds he goes through hell week with the class and amazingly no one drops out during the entire week earning it a no bell prize when they would graduate he then describes the post hell week atmosphere from learning the basics of land warfare to combat diving physics when it was still in its early stages chuck survives the rigors of bud s and graduates with his classmates who all are honored by the instructors as a class that cannot quit after bud s chuck goes to fort benning georgia to attend the army airborne school to earn basic wings he is met by a united states marine corps officer in charge of navy students attending this school who was not amused nor impressed by bud s graduates who attended the school the reason why bud s graduates pull pranks on the airborne school staff was because they wanted to provoke the instructors into punishing them often which bud s graduates treat as a joke after spending at least six months in coronado begin hammered by their own instructors with more vigorous pt  chuck describes the various pranks the bud s graduates all did there to poke fun of the instructors they climbed up jump towers to hang beat army banners there they took spray paint and tagged army officers cars and parking lots with gay and proud and handicap for hire  the marine officer said if he did any kinds of these pranks with other bud s graduates he would instantly be transferred to the regular fleet which chuck takes somewhat seriously sort of while at airborne school chuck met up with fellow bud s students to exercise more than anyone else there just for show and to keep up shape and of course pull pranks on the final day when chuck was on a c130 for a graduation jump his two class 114 friends distract an army instructor to steal his hat and jump before getting caught chuck gets in trouble at the drop zone but fortunately earns his airborne wings given by an army instructor who disliked the bud s graduates along with his friends who still have the hat he is becoming closer to becoming a seal at that point at the same time chuck receives orders to report to seal team four at virginia beach chuck arrives at virginia beach to begin his advanced operater training with seal team 4 before he can officially become a navy seal the team welcomes him by having a couple of enlisted members dunk him in a water tank before sending him off to gather his new gear he is designated as operator 156 for easy recognition by the team cadre that looks after the team chuck begins to adapt to his new team meeting up with a friend and officer who arrived earlier frank giffland and a friend from class 114 who have already become seals he begins qualifying for his naval wings which every seal is required to make ten jumps after his final qualifying jump chuck is rewarded this unceremoniously by a vietnam vet master chief petty officer mike boynton whom he greatly respects due to how he covered his office work so that chuck would be able to participate in team routines chuck also begins to train with another vietnam veteran named chief petty officer john jaeger who trains new officers john for some particular reason dislikes chuck in the beginning calling him derogative humor names whenever he screws up eventually chuck respects john for his way of teaching him on how to be a leader and being a role model on how to survive in the wilderness chuck also comments on how the team liked john for his diverse background he was rumored to be born in a nazi generic experiment he was a hard core smoker who smoked after finishing a swim or any exercise he was an m60 machine gun gunner in vietnam and loved using the phrase or so after each sentence he said this makes chuck a little more comfortable with the team as the months go by chuck learns the essential skills of being a seal operator along with other candidates he learns how to use c4 in different ways he learns how to avoid bloodhounds russian tactics how to handle various enemy weapons and other skills that seal s need to learn chuck says that while the newcomers are learning all of this they are being followed by cadre members known as lane graders who attach themselves to the group thelane graders made sure that a procedure was done right and that no team member lied during a debriefing they were also there to supervise on the process on becoming seals by checking on how the newcomers work as team and as individuals but if the candidates did not abide by this they were gone near the end of this process chuck and other members are sent off to participate in robin sage as the opfor the purpose of the seal presence was to intentionally not allow any green beret candidate to do anything right bydoing direct action missions against them and their pinelander allies the seal team was to do everything to a high standard otherwise they risk losing their operator certifications for not being able to win screwing up chuck is in charge of a team who s objective is to find a green beret camp and destroy it the team is dropped off in the woods and told to meet a chieu hoi informat chuck is first skeptical about the informant thinking it was a setup but his already qualified enlisted man baby zee convinces him to meet the informant the informant is a military police who is playing the role of a pinelanderin robin sage who tells chuck on where to find the camp unfortunately for chuck s team the informant cannot read a map so chuck had to use his training to figure out where the camp is fortunately the team discovers the campwhen its inhabitants slaughter a live pig for dinner chuck waits until dusk as he prepares to attack the camp he has one boat crew a team go on one side of the camp to flank the camp while he had his team move close to the camp from there they were to suppress fire on the camp chuck waits for the green berets and their patrol to leavethe camp with four others before he orders to fire his team fires first confusing the pinelanders and green berets making chuck order the other boat crew to add in additional fire chuck s team then charges into the camp kill the pinelanders the green berets fled and loots it before requesting for a helicopter extraction the mission was a complete success sometime later chuck is given his first real world assignment to prove that he s worthy of receiving the naval special warfare badge he was not getting a mission that he liked at all observing the us navy test fire a trident missile the recover its rocket engine when it detaches chuck and a friend head down to florida to watch the navy test fire it as they prepared to recover the rocket engine however soviet trawlers observing also head towards the engine to attempt to retrieve it chuck is left with no choice but to destroy the engine to not let it fall into soviet hands he and his friend jump from the helicopter with c4 explosives which they wrapped around the rocket and extracted before it blew up the rocket is destroyed and the soviets failed in retrieving the rocket chuck is considered okay by the team and his finally given the trident at last he was a navy seal as an official member of seal team four now chuck gets into the routine of the regular seal life besides spending numerous hours training on the base or at fort ap hill the team is deployed at some point overseas with theregular navy in which chuck still is unspecific in these deployments are not classified yet  on the non combat side of life the team often frequented a bar in virginia beach that has been inhabited by the udt and the first seal s over the years chuck also dates a number of women during this time he first dates a nurse then a naval and many others but was not successful in getting a long term relationship as the years go by chuck gets command of his own platoon in the team he remains friends with frank giffland who he is influenced by while befriending others in his new platoon one of theseis a navy corpsman named doc who is a vietnam veteran the platoon heads down to the panama canal to participate in a joint military exercise with the panamanian defense forces withmany seal s having a skeptical thought on them chuck reveals that some of the panamanians were the soldiers waiting to kill seal s years later during operation nifty package during this exercise the joint team successfully raid the gatun locks and other facilities surrounding the canal the final exercise which consisted only of seal s including one of chuck s aot instructor john jaeger is to simulate a takeover and sinking of a us navy ship for obvious reasons chuck is vague in the description of the takeover of the ship but concludes that the exercise was a successful task for the seal s participating and it creates a friendship between john and chuck some days later chuck and john s platoon flights home are delayed so both men let their teams head to bars in town chuck and john decide to follow some of them and strip off their insignia rates to go into the enlisted bar there they find tension building up between members of force recon green berets and seal s who are ready to beat each other up john finally ends the tension when he attracts all the attention to himself and gets a tall green beret to look after the men while he went to the bathroom this ends the tension between all the special forces men in the enlisted bar home for the new year chuck sends his platoon to their own homes and families to celebrate the new year while staying back to keep watch over the team s base finding that there was really nothing else to do chuck heads off to a party that he is invited to by a friend who works closely with the seal s he is a nightstalker  at the party he meets margot a woman from buffalo new york who is a mutual friend they soon quickly leave the party and head to margot s house chuck waits for margot when she appears to him nude and they have sex this begins hisfirst long term relationship with margot some time later chuck and frank are given notices by the command to do a special task one of them are to do a hydrographic recon on a beach near puerto leimpra honduras for a naval force to land there chuck and frank at first head down to honduras do a personal recon themselves with a cia agent of the area they both find a suitable beach to recon before heading hometo prepare to return frank decides to take the platoon to ap hill for initial combat testing while chuck is left with the task of the recon he picks four others to do the task with him surfer dave stan tim and bubba once he does the group is put on isolation while the rest of the platoon head up to ap hill the next day the groupis flown over the uss fairfax and free fall to the ocean before meeting up with the ship onboard the captain and chuck discuss the recon and chuck goes over all the details with the groupbefore the mission begins the fairfax goes into commercial shipping traffic before giving chuck s team the signal to release their zodiac boat into the sea the group heads towards honduras to begin their recon chuck s boat encounters big waves while heading into the surf zone near the bay where the beach was located thanks to chuck s knowledge of surfing they make it safely into the bay putting a rendevousmarker into the bay the team puts their boat on shore then splits to conduct a hydrographic recon of the beach as soon as they finish they head to the boat to go to the rendevous point they set up but themarker is mysteriously missing when the team gets there alerting chuck they soon discover a nicaraguan patrol boat that had entered the bay founded the marker and were now looking for the seal team inside the bay the team not wanting to be discovered quietly moves toward a fishing pier to hide under it before they could they awaken two natives who live on the pier tim attempts to speak spanish to them but to no avail but chuck discovers that they spoke french he explains that the natives cannot snitch the team to the patrolboat in which they obey thanking them when they did not chuck gives one of the natives his knife before moving the boat out deciding to stall the patrol boat which was close but not alerted yet chuck ties glowsticks together andhooks them to a tree while the patrol boat opens fire on the glowsticks the team move out of the bay tohead towards the surf zone as they rode a wave they are shocked to see that the patrol boat follows out ofthe bay too fortunately for the team the surf stalls the patrol boat and
