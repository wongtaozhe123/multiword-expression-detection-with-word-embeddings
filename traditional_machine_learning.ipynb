this be a shame of my adorable town , branford . i order a kid meal with a milk and find a bottle be half open already . i ask them to change it but they rudely say that it be okay . disgusting french fries be very best menu . do n\\'t go , or you will learn how to waste your money . we decide to try this place last night because we notice that it have some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual roll -- live scallop sashimi , duck breast nigiri with foie gras , panko mussel -- but none of these be particularly great or worth the sticker price . additionally we try the logan circle roll , spicy crab and tuna roll , and sweet potato tempura roll ( $ 15 , $ 10 , and $ 3.75 respectively ) . the sweet potato tempura roll be actually a great surprise : cheap and delicious , the only thing we try that i would say be well worth it and a great value ( and i never get vegetarian roll ) . the other roll be n\\'t at all special , especially give their pricing . the bottom line be that the food be n\\'t great and be relatively high - priced . but i \\'d go elsewhere unless the price be cut . it \\'s just not worth it . i be recently travel down i - 24 from nashville with my 3 young child and have a blowout on the southeast side of murfreesboro . not only do they answer the phone at 4:50 on a thursday , they hit the ground move !. after seventeen days the delivery van show up at my home minus two piece . i be later tell they have be leave at the warehouse and some future date they would be deliver . the new centre have 4 studio plan and now boast the large single dance floor area in kingston upon hull . fast and great service on pool cover not only be i be bilk for money i do not owe , the office staff be rude to boot . i have a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail . then i get a bill for $ 483.00 . the office refuse my request to see what they get from bc / bs . recommend you call in for a look . we just have our wedding on 11/7/08 and be very impressed . i just move nearby and have try several of the local place , this be the first one and i should have just stick with it . baffle by the one - star review i will 4 - ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my sicilian family show me when i be there for 3 years . we be in santa fe for a special event and our host rent out the el paradero for all their guest to stay at . the weekend be perfect in every way , in large part to sue and her great staff . everyone be so friendly and really go out of their way to make sure everything go well . i recently throw a surprise birthday party for my wife at fraiser \\'s . we have 30 guest for the event , and everyone come away from the evening impressed with not only the food , but the outstanding service as well . the management be easy to deal with during the planning stage , and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff be flawless . i highly recommend fraiser \\'s for anyone plan a special event for friend , family or business . excellent food , fantastic wait staff it be ok , nice management , they let us check in early , but the place be old . it be clean , but just a little dumpy . hard to get into though because of road construction . great , honest service the dealer want $ 1300 to fix that and another $ 1500 to fix some other things . eagle transmission determine that much of the work the dealer say need to be do be unneccesary and what need to be fix be only $ 400 !! i drop the truck off in the morning and it be ready that afternoon . i have finally find a mechanic i trust !! and it be great that they do not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem - an add bonus !! they do that with no problem . move with a pod be the best moving experience i have have . after all she will only be a baby for so long i figure why not enjoy it . ** edit : live on campus at clarkson university , i have have food deliver before . this be back between \\'05 and \\'09 and i do n\\'t remember how many times we \\'ve have it deliver . it s like a pizza roll , but they just toss ham and cheese inside . also , you can call em ahead of time , and then go to pick up ur food , or have it deliver ** . it usually take 20 min for a mezza luna , as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix . do n\\'t judge a book by it cover this could n\\'t be farther from the truth . the warm chocolate cake be very tasty , but serve at room temperature , not warm by any stretch of the imagination . ps ) when we call for a reservation , we be tell that 5:00 and 9:30 be their only opening . when we arrive at 5 , and leave circa 7 , there be the same 4 or 5 empty table surround us . the waiting staff be beyond impeccable ( they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom ) . a great vacation ! we want to see the sun - and we also get much more ! excellent chef be in the kitchen prepare memorable breakfast . after a train ride over the mountain , we enjoy hike in the flower - fill wenatchee hill ( in may ) and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the columbia river ... and then wine if we want it on the patio in the evening .... this be a busy group of host they be also run a restaurant , which also must be wonderful - so just ask for what you need , and i \\'m sure they will do their best to be hospitable . best food in northeast there s a reason why frank mcclelland be name best chef of the north east reigon . food here be absolutely superb . everything be delicous and cook perfectly . if you want great food then l\\'espalier be the place to go . best pizza and calzones in the city !

i love them !!! okay , here \\'s the scoop . i \\'m a regular at the hh . the food be excellent , the serivce be horrible . i think they \\'re still in the mindset from when it be only smoker sit around and drink ... not in any hurry . in my experience the food have be excellent ( for the most part ) . however , the bartender / waitress definately need to be re-trained ( if they ever have any to begin with ) and learn two things : only chat with customer when other customer be not impatiently wait and to look around more often to see if person be wait . in some case the result be because of understaffing , in some case the staff just do n\\'t care / know better . they must also get something to keep take - out warm , so it \\'s not room temperature at best when you get it home . you just have to know what you \\'re get into when you go . nice local pub , excellent food ( especially wings ) , and do n\\'t go if you have a limited amount of time . clean & tidy with good atmosphere & pleasant staff . food drastically let the place down though stay away horrible service . absolutely rude . do services i ask them not to do and be still charge . awesome bacon egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast . cheap drink in keene !

the management from julie and janice to the work staff , esp. edwin , be just wonderful . they have be extremely helpful whenever i have ask for help . although the apartment be face stokes street and close to the bascom light rail , the location be surprisingly quiet . i have never have any problem with loud neighbor or concern about safety . the apartment be within walking distance to trader joe \\'s , whole foods , and other store . the well - equip , clean gym be a plus ! great place to live if you work in and around downtown san jose ! check in real late , but staff be very kind and helpful . rooms very clean and smell very fresh . i would recommend this hotel to anyone . i love my stay here and if ever back in the area , i will be stay here again . good clean store nice car wash room ok . service and client base not ok . i have stay in this hotel many times , and while it typically offer a decent bang for the buck , it client base largely consist of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local , not so pleasant hood . i have never consider this a real problem as i travel without kid and can fend for myself , but when i have to listen to a ( non-violent ) domestic fight that last from 1 am to 5 am during my last stay and i find out that the front desk be unmanned during night hours , my choice be to either waste tax payer money by call for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel , or just get over it . i choose the later , but approach the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibility on local authorities , not to mention the good night s sleep i pay for but do nt get . i be tell management would call me back but still wait for that call . i will probably stay here again because it s cheap and i ca nt afford a better hotel , but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for family or single female traveller . nice selection , very clean , friendly staff ! hot iron have become a favorite of our family . everyone can get the signature dish with ingredient and spice that they want and have the fun of watch it cook . the staff be very friendly and conscientious . they always ask if you have meat in your dish , ( for vegetarian like me ) , they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensil to cook . they do n\\'t just dump your ingredient on and cook either , but carefully separate meat to the hot parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggie from turn to mush . the selection of meat , veggie and sauce be awesome too ! every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keep things interesting . meat be keep very cold , seafood smell fresh and the serving bar be very clean . price be reasonable , ( kid s meal be around 4.99 ) and wednesday\\'s they have discount dinner price , i believe . exile be the best !!! exile be the longest last and most authentic punk store in richmond ! i have be shop there for over six years now . the staff be incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner , mimmy , be an absolute angel . the mark up be minimal consider that the clothing be hard to find and often ship for europe . in addition , the clothing be of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic , which be make as cheaply as possible by person live in horrible conditions in asia . exile be environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community . shop local at exile !!

disappointed the bad : i be at napa recently and be unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food . we be a party of 4 and none of us be particularly pleased with our dish . napa be all about wine but give very short description of the wine on their list . i find my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we choose to be poorly compose . if you must go ask lots of question about your selection since your expectation may as high as mine be . awesome bagel long line on the weekend but worth it long line , silly rule , rude staff , ok food the first thing you notice when you arrive on location be that the waiting line literally go out the door and spill into the parking lot . a restaurant with this many patron willing to stand in line just to order taco must be good , right ? i mean , that \\'s the way it work at amusement parks : the long line be at the best ride . well , this may be an exception . the staff take your order and PUNCT wait PUNCT on you be very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all . i have get better result talk to comcast customer service than with these folks . and do n\\'t even think about ask to speak to the manager because this guy be , and pardon my french , a jerk . if you have get through ordering , deal with the rude staff and if you follow the dumb rule , you be finally present with what you come for .. some taco that be PUNCT ok , PUNCT but definitely not worth put up with all the hassle . save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together . i suggest you go up to rage taco & rage burrito a couple of block up the street or even taco mac . aweesome holy cow be that a delicious meal . hot , fresh , delicious . love every bit of it . :) holly - the owner , know exactly how to make you feel beautiful in clothes . stylish and contemporary , no matter your size or personality type . she \\'s an a + and so be her clothes !

PUNCT unless you want to take the PUNCT tell the customer how wrong she be and try and force her into a dress she \\'s obviously not love PUNCT approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere . seriously : do not waste your time . other shop around this city have much nice and more transparent owner . not owner that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service . i felt very much like wedding gallery be be dishonest and i would n\\'t trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown i will wear on the most important day of my life . channel guide believe it or not , but the channel guide have be most helpful to my family member that visit and do n\\'t know where to start when it come to watch satellite tv . i just give them guide and they can find anything they need . thanks again , directv . rude rude rude go in there and get my dog groom come home to an uneven dog then take him back to get even up what a mistake !

PUNCT the inspection guy be n\\'t here today PUNCT .... for example . today i go into kwik kar and there be two car in front of me for inspection ... but i be still out of there pretty quick ... barely have time to read a chapter in my book . awful awful awful this store be by far the worst verizon store i \\'ve be in . the salesperson be never available , the line be always too long , and all the person want be a sale . incredibly rude and i will not return to it . be there no other verizon to go to around downtown / dupont circle 1?!?!? auto towing be one of the best towing services i have use . the first time i use them they arrive on time and tow car for me to the destination i need . the auto mechanics that work for auto towing be very friendly and informative and answer any question i have . if you be look for towing services that can offer you a good tow car service , then auto towing be the company for you . do n\\'t expect sleep or courtesy these be not household type alarm . when they sound off , it be a true audio / visual experience . i call the front desk and get no answer . after check for sign of fire or smoke and see none , i decide to just pack up and leave . he finally admit that only the 4 ada room alarm have sound , so only 4 guest be effect ( no big deal to him ) . this little drip offer no apology whatsoever , and even refuse to give me the name of the manager until i press him for it 3 times . this hotel be adequate enough , but there be an obvious problem with the staff and management . do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night . average food and deathly slow service i have eat here several times and every time the service be slow than slow . one time we even leave after sit at the table for 20 minutes and not be greet with a drink order . ridiculous . there must be a better mexican place in rockland . farrell electric be a very good electrical contractor . i \\'m pleased that someone refer me to them for my commercial business . i own a property management firm and need a contractor with the credentials that farrell electric have . sanctuary be amazing ! sanctuary serve delicious , somewhat healthy food in a great restaurant / fast food style . the employee be really friendly . and they deliver ! food be often expired so check the date every time ! also more often than not you end up with a healthy dose of nasty rude attitude from the employee ! highly recommend we walk in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and hear laughter from kid and the staff . the facility be more than adequate and the staff be just phenomenal . their sense of humour and calmness when deal with the little one amaze me every time i walk in . we have since move slightly further away from the centre but it \\'s worth the extra travel , as the care provide exceed our expectation ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experience elsewhere . they have fresh flower , last a long while in the vase , and the two lady at the shop know the business well . i have no problem with my delivery . i will go there again . we come at around 730 and they close at 8 and want to try the special but they be out for the day so i would say go way before they close . get the crab rangoon which be great , tofu with cabbage which be spicy but good and shrimp satay which be also good . def go to come back and try this place again . bea be really nice and ask how the food be . cute place also great job on my roof and the pricing be fair . will use again in the future . lovely cottage this cottage be a charming homely , friendly , place to stay . mary be an excellent host who do yummy breakfast . my room be delightful and the attention to detail be amazing . will come again ! sophie . i just like the fact that he be able to do the specific type of repair i want ( a reball ) and give me the long warranty and even a low price . someone else i find that say they could do it but want to charge me more and give me less warranty . it be a no brainer really . i choose console pros and i \\'m happy i do . where else can you go for $ 10 and recieve this treatment ?! who can pass up a hot towel and a straight edge neck shave ! i \\'ve have 2 cut now from georgia and have pay more in other salon / barbershop and have not receive this kind of treatment or cut ! excellent service i could easily go to nordstrom for my designer jean and pay the same price , but i go to the garment district for their service . previous reviewer say they be pushy and i can understand that , but i find the staff more helpful than anything else . tiffany be fabulous ! i come in for alteration ( free , by the way ) and tell her about a stain i have on my new leather purse . she immediately go to the back , bring out leather cleaner and clean my purse on the spot . i do n\\'t even buy the bag there ! huge selection and , great suggestion from the staff and they refer you to reliable place if they do n\\'t have what you need . have a horrible experience with a manager here , rachel mcinnis , she be rude , inconsiderate and do not do the right thing for an item that be mark incorrectly ... i \\'m not interested in shop in a place with person like her ... she refuse to sell me the item at it mark price even after admit they have make a mistake . i normally do n\\'t write review but see that i consider dillards a distinguished , upscale place to shop , this one wo n\\'t be get my business , nor my family \\'s , nor my co-worker . it \\'s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy , especially when they be right . i love my gym ! fitness unlimited be a second home to a lot of us gym member who work out daily . if you be serious about work out in a non-commercial like atmosphere then you have choose the best place to be . this be the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body do n\\'t be surprised when you see how addicting go to fitness unlimited can be !! good food and very friendly staff . interesting good value wine list to . beer a bit expensive . food good , service poor no silverware , ask for a spoon for my son s mac and cheese end up have to use my tea spoon . ask for bar - b - que sauce never get it . never check back with us once we get our food . have to go the the bus boy s station ourselves to get napkin . food be good , but service mean a lot to me . antique lighting , fixture , chicago i visit their huge chicago lighting showroom and all i have to say be wow !! lots of collection , many antique light fixture , chandelier , custom lighting etc . i think they have the large collection for chandelier chicago . antique , vintage , contemporary & modern chandelier . rude service even though i have never try hoa salon but i agree with other reviewer that they be rude . he tell us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price . what kind of rude service be that ? i do n\\'t want to waste my time with them . range rover sport window tint mark at tintman nationwide tints ltd , do a very professional job very quick , no fuss , deliverd the car to me and i drive him back home , great arrangement great price !! highly recommend !! thanks mark . steve .... proud range rover sport owner ( with rear tint ) best store in boothbay harbor what a fantastic store , i love this place . not the same old stuff that all the other store have . their item be very unique , great quality , great price . they also have the best tea i ever have , not at all like the junk you get at the grocery store , i stock up when ever there because they be closed in the winter . amazing customer service i think the woman at this salon know that their business be base primarily from referral . :) they be amazingly hospitable . edit be the best massage therapist i \\'ve ever have and i would highly recommend her ! simple , quick take away . bit sketchy , sporadic delivery times i buy about half of the furniture i own from this place . why ? because they cut me good deal if i pay in cash . sketchy , right ? well they come through and deliver almost all of my item within a few days . ( they even get me a couch pretty quickly . ) the guy who be cut me the deal and get me the furniture quickly , ahmed , be nice and mostly professional , except the semi-sketchiness . then one day , ahmed leave the country , not to return for month , without inform me . he also neglect to tell the other person work at the store about a dining room table that i have order and that be suppose to be come in . the other person work at the store do n\\'t know that i still have this table come . i have pay in cash , and he say he have no receipt / record of my purchase . i come back with the receipt ahmed have provide upon my purchase , and the guy take forever to copy it but say that he would take care of the situation . i wait . and wait . he never once contact us . i \\'ve have to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive . he keep say different arrival / delivery date and do n\\'t seem terribly apologetic . it have be 3 week and i still do n\\'t have my table ( which be not cheap , i might add ) . point be : you might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which i do -- but they \\'re not very communicative and god forbid something go wrong , you \\'ll have to fight to get it resolve . a staple ! branch out and try something other than the pad thai , the curry be fantastic . fast and friendly service , they know my order when i walk in the door ! bad food and bad service ! save yourself a trip ! i generally like the bk over the other fast serve restaurant ; however , i regret to visit this restaurant at my town . the service be solicitous , the atmosphere be nice and mod except the out - of - place flat - screen tv play football . i love the atmosphere here and the food be good , however the table be so close together that it feel very cramped . we be make to feel very welcome . well worth a visit . http://cambridgefoodfrivolity.blogspot.com/ liquidweb.com rock !!! i be not a client of liquidweb.com , but one of my friend call steven be the client have several website . i work with him and since past 6 years he be host his website to liquidweb . as i have go through many review site to see if any provider be provide better services or not , and i have realize that there be many good review about liquidweb also steven never face any server issue in his whole hosting . the kind of support they provide be simply great !!! i would like to host my upcoming website to liquidweb.com terrible service one of the worst experience i \\'ve ever have with a auto repair shop . we take our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning . approx 4 month later , the compressor go out . we take it back in to have it repair again , and less than a week later the second compressor go out . we go in for a third visit and they fix it again , but this time when we pick up the car , the radio and clock do not work . so for the 4th time in 5 month and the third time in 2 week , we bring the car back again . when we express our discontent to the manager ( that \\'s right , the manager ) , do he say he would return some money , do he say he would give a discount on our next visit , do he just say PUNCT i \\'m sorry PUNCT . nope , none of the above . he stand there and tell us how he be n\\'t at fault . it be the fault of the parts supplier , and can we imagine how he felt have to put another 2 hours of work in the car . and what do we expect ... that he bench test every part . at no time during the conversation do the words , PUNCT i \\'m sorry PUNCT ever come out of his mouth . i , nor anyone else in my family , will ever go to sun devil auto again . well , unless of course the third compressor he put in the car go out . awesome food ! make sure to put oily sauce on your food to make it moist ! yum simple but perfect if you want flashy fancy food stack high with lots of fussy garnish , this be not the place for you . if you want perfectly execute simple dish that feature a few exquisite ingredient , you \\'ll love vetri . hands - down the best pasta and gnocchi i \\'ve ever eat ( and i \\'ve eat a lot ) . the antipasti be amazing , the wine be mind - blowing , the service could n\\'t have be better . i \\'ve dine at lots of high - end restaurant and i \\'ve never before felt my money be so well spend . worst place flour tortilla be always hard the beef enchilada be discussing meat all over cook be good many yr ago but restaurant have go down hill the internet here be terrible . like the previous poster say , the com line be split between the entire building . that \\'s 3 x worse than qwest dsl \\'s lowest speed offering ! the outward appearance make you think this place be nice , but everything inside be cheap cheap cheap . move out as soon as our lease be up . http://www.speedtest.net/result/1155244347.png you can fool person this store be proof that you can fool person with good advertising . they convince lots of person that they be a great store , when in fact they be a very average place at best , they be just another big box store like the others . they offer sales that be n\\'t really sales , mislabeled item that make the item sound like a good deal when it be n\\'t , a bad attitude about return item , and on and on . with higher than average price to boot ! so do n\\'t get take in , keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here . on the other hand , the richmond ukrops chain be know for it charity work , it community action , and it interest in the public welfare . usually very quick and timely . doctor bogomilsky know her stuff too . david be amazing david be the most helpful and creative photographer that i have use . he be willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation . he be patient and adapt when everything do n\\'t go accord to schedule on my wedding day . both the engagement and wedding picture that he take for us we absolutely amazing . he get the picture back to me quickly . i would highly recommend david to anyone . he will exceed your expectation ! he do n\\'t just take picture he make art out of them and you wo n\\'t even notice that there \\'s a camera there . junkie lube ?! really weird place , i be drive home from work think i \\'d stop in for an oil change and well , there be a few guy in jiffy lube uniform sit at the table drink beer and shoot the breeze . the neon lighting sign still say PUNCT on PUNCT yet some guy who seem to be the old of the bunch , more like the drunk of the bunch tell me they \\'d be open tomorrow . i ask if a manager be on duty he tell me he be . wow ! grey shirt PUNCT mark PUNCT of course with this type behavior he could have be wear someon else s clothing ..... super nice person , really good food what i love most about this place , other than the food , be that eat here make you feel like you \\'re in a small town rather than baltimore . the owner be really nice , they serve good food at a good price , and the option to eat outside on the deck ( esp on the weekend whether there be hardly any traffic ) be great . one of my top 5 place to eat in baltimore . michael help shoot the majority of my firm \\'s website and we could not have be happy . we go through six photographer to find the right photographer that would represent our firm in the light we wish to and michael and his team make that happen . he \\'s worth every penny . this be a ralph \\'s i just call this number and it be a ralph \\'s market . the world \\'s fair museum be pretty cool . too expensive the food \\'s okay , but the price be outrageous . wow , the representative go way above and beyond in help me with my account set up . i wish the other utility i have to set up have person to work with like this .. professional and inspiring nigel from nidd design have always provide a first class service , from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawing and planning application . his knowledge and expertise help smooth the way with any planning application , ensure compliance with the building regulation . once you have meet nigel you will not want to work with anyone else . he really do turn your dream into reality for your home ! impressive truly impressive the first time i walk in there with my teacup chihuahua puppy i know i \\'d be here a lot . pets discount have lovely employee , a wonderful grooming service , and everything i need to keep my dog in tip top condition ! deep tissue massage help with pain in neck and shoulder seth provide deep tissue massage which have significantly reduce the pain in my neck and shoulder and add flexibility and movement back to the area . he listen and be excellent in diagnose , address and explain the specific issue and suggest exercise to use . fhs be a good high school -- c / o 1998 i enjoy my time at franklin high school . we have relatively good facility at the time -- decent science lab , with multiple hood and access to good equipment ; nice gymnasium , and a well - fund music department ( i be in the guitar ensemble ) . now , of course , there \\'s a new building , with presumably better facility . all to the good . for those who care , a good proportion of the my class go on to 4 - year college , many of them rank in the top 50 of us news . if i remember , student go to dartmouth , u. penn , duke , bu , william and mary , vassar , howard , and carnegie mellon , among others . many student go to rutgers , include their top - rank pharmacy program . the point be -- fhs give you the opportunity to make it to a good college , but you need to work hard . prepare the road test with a driving ... prepare the road test with a driving school in edmonton , but my instructor only train me in a narrow street , hence i take one 90 minute lesson from the noble driving school to learn the skill of change lane , and find them very friendly and professional . this place be bad . it \\'s dark , dingy & dirty . the salad be limp and the rest of the food be n\\'t any better ( ok , the nacho be not too bad ! ) this place may have be something sometime ; but it way past it PUNCT sell by date PUNCT . i have eat here twice in the past year and will not go back and can not recommend it . le petit be the best place to get your nail do ! it be very clean , staff be friendly , and i have never wait ! i go every other week for the shallac / gel manicure which be only $ 25 and it truly last 2 week ! i love it . pedicure be also great . try this place out ! i promise you will not be disappoint ! great barber firstly , the other reviewer clearly have never be to nick \\'s , or he would know that nick only charge $ 13 for a haircut which be pretty much industry standard . i have be go to nick for 5 month now precisely because he do pay attention to detail . i have terrible hair and he really take his time to make it look right . some of the younger kid that work there be a bit sub par , but if you wait for nick ... you \\'ll be good . remember see PUNCT stop make sense PUNCT at cinema 21 multiple times ! yay , great theater !!! do n\\'t waste your money on the jukebox the bartender be a douchebag and he have a little console behind the bar where he can delete song he do n\\'t like , and you end up pay for it . not enough seating . orr \\'s a nightmare ! do n\\'t go ! my boyfriend and i be wake up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kid who \\'d arrive around 1:00 am and be drink at the spring . when we complain to the management ( as we be instruct to do if there be any problem ) , nothing happen ! then , the next morning , when we , among many other irate guest , ask to speak to the owner , he refuse to do so . not only that , but he tell us , via his manager , that it be our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continue , even though his manager do nothing the first time to stop the kid . orr be not relaxing , it \\'s not a safe space , and the owner be awful . to add insult to injury , he refuse to refund our money . do n\\'t go !

i will definitely be bring my car back for service . prime rib be very tough . staff be pleasant . wo n\\'t return . great first experience . i \\'m 22 , and my hairdresser be great ( and not PUNCT old PUNCT like one of the review say ) - she really listen to what i want and give me tons of tip on how to style my hair so i could get it to look the way i want it to . she deep condition my hair and take the time to style it properly . she recommend product but absolutely do n\\'t pressure me to buy . it \\'s a cute place with a really friendly , laid - back atmosphere . i would highly recommend it and will be go back for my next haircut . oh ! and student get $ 5 off , ca n\\'t argue with that . i guess you get what you pay for . i try to stay here for a few night with my girlfriend , so we ask for a single queen bed . we get there , and we be treat to the free PUNCT upgrade PUNCT of a room with two double bed . since they consider this an upgrade , they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room . then we get put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine . we could hear every single thing that happen outside like it be inside our room . when i finally find someone at the desk who could speak english , they move our room , but we still do not receive the single queen we have PUNCT reserve PUNCT it \\'s well cool . :) the best there be in service . it be 4:50 when a friend tell me to call bud , he would take care of me . they track down the only tire that fit my bmw 330i in murfreesboro within minutes and secure it , then they come out , take off my tire ( it be a runflat - but runflats do n\\'t do you any good if they blow out ) , and bring it to their shop to change the tire . they be back quickly consider how far outside of murfreesboro we be and have us on our way by 6:30 that evening . thanks bud for all of your help and take time away from your family that evening . it \\'s without a doubt , the best service experience i \\'ve ever have and just to be clear , the price he charge me be the same as my tire guy in nashville \\'s price for put on the other rear tire . i hope i can return the favor in the future ! alan grissom gone library be closed . it be now bislas . poor service after fire this company my next pool service find the filter have not be clean as they should have be . i would recommend not use this company . marisol this place be awesome twelve do an amazing job place be clean and staff be friendly another great business bite the dust ! the best cake ever ! a bit pricey , so i do n\\'t go very often , but it be always a treat when i do . the price be worth what i get . i \\'m assume they be completely out of business since i ca n\\'t find any contact information . i \\'m hope the baker continue to do their baking out of another place , because it would be a shame not to have these cake any longer . poor service run do n\\'t walk . my experience with home delivery service have be one of disappointment and anger . if i could give them a low rating than poor i would . on august 21st , 2009 i order furniture from hickory furniture mart and contract for hds to deliver it . no one will give me a date . i spend $ 2300 on the bedroom suite , which be complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor . upon delivery it be clear the entire set be damage : a piece of wood be broke on the headboard ; the chest of drawers be miss all four piece necessary to attach the legs ; the dresser back legs be push in cause the dresser to lean into the wall ; and a nighstand be miss a drawer . how do you lose a drawer . after complain on september 10th to national home furnishings , boyles , the hickory furniture mart and home delivery service the latter finally call me back and say they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repair and at some later point it would be return . the customer service at home delivery service be terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture . so i be in limbo regard a bedroom suite . i hope the owner and employee of this store have break bedroom suite in their home and furniture sit in someone \\'s warehouse . maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service . might try again pro : * jill , the owner , be very nice and really care about her feedback * pretty nice atmosphere * great dessert * not your typical veggie selection , i like ! do n\\'t know where else you can find purple hull pea and some of the other side . con : * server be n\\'t very pleasant * pretty small portion on the blacken catfish * overcook food * time , take about 25 minutes from ordering to eating . half the table and bar be empty by this point . other thought : will try this place again . there must be a reason so many person like it there . their club sandwich look tasty , maybe that \\'ll change my mind .... and a different server . rubbish take 1 + hour to deliver to chatham , hair in food , driver do n\\'t know area . notice a few of these cookie cutter place open in summit and new providence . stick to hop hing , 20 year + resident . new training centre be excellent the award dance centre have move from it holderness road site to a new complex on chamberlain road hull . the class cover all age and skill range , with ballroom , latin , sequence , street , disco , line dancing , ballet , tap & jazz . we have attend a ward dance centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we be teach ballroom and latin as well as the fun fill social dance evening hold every saturday evening .... it be not really possible to score this school too highly , we would give it 12 out of 10 and 5 star across the board steve & anne unique gift and cards friendly , fine food the one - star review from 2005 be out of date . there be a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service be both quick and extremely friendly . the food continue to be very good -- deli sandwich , homemade soup , fresh salad . the atmosphere may not be for everyone . it be a bustling place where separate party be seat at the same table ( as in many european cafe ) , but if you be ok with that , the food be very good . love the soup . best cigar lounge on the blouvard . encino have be bless by the opening of this smoke shop most definately . if you mention the name amir you will receive % 10 off at time of purchase best yet ! we go to japaneiro \\'s all the time and we have never be disappoint ! wait staff be always ready to help if you ca n\\'t decide ( which happen every time for me d / t the huge menu of roll ) and always courteous ! soooo tasty ! after recently relocate to south bend , we be look for a delicious , fun , yet elegant establishment for new year s eve dinner . we be disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal , and accessibility to the jazz club . the meal be extremely overpriced and lack flavor , especially for be a special nye menu . the limited menu have few appetizing option and the nye special package be way overpriced . after our meal , our server find us a table in the jazz club where we be inform it would be another $ 10 / person to stay and listen to the band , despite the fact we have just finish a dinner there and be intend to enjoy their drink list . this be a less than impressive experience at trio \\'s . need to go out of business they close whenever they feel like it , often well before their list closing time . their store be dusty , dirty and feel like you \\'re step into the 1970s . they do n\\'t take coupon . they have a credit card minimum . this place be the opposite of quiktrip : crappy in every way . all i can say be that i be glad i go in !

take a laptop in for a video cable to be replace . everything except the display work fine before i take it in . the video cable be replace and suddenly the motherboard be dead . phone call be n\\'t return when promise and the botch repair take a week longer than promise . grocery and daily need store before use fusionretail before instal fusionretail store be run on a dos base software . we be have a major problem in maintain cash . be a grocery shop , maintain 5000 different product be a challenging job . manage po counter without barcoding be really a tough time . how fusionretail have overcome these issue ? fusionretail help us to maintain the store in an organised way . usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale , purchase and return be never easy before . how long do it take to train new person at work ? billing take 15 minutes and back office job take 1 day \\'s training how fast your support query get answer ? over telephone , immediate . on call , it take a day to get our issue resolve . it \\'s now call sushi lover . food be just okay .. wo n\\'t crave it , but would n\\'t mind come back for a quick meal . natasha be the best photographer we have ever work with . she have a great way with child and be able to capture their personality as well as many spontaneous image . you will not be disappoint with her work !! make you feel like a number stay away from kids first west chester . you never get a human on the phone . it \\'s impossible to get an appointment . if you get catch in traffic and be a couple minutes late they make you re-schedule ... for 6 week later . and worst of all your child feel like a number not a patient . go somewhere else . dr. white be the best ! awful service ! after happily visit sear\\'s automotives in the past , i be shocked at the horrible service receive at their greensboro location . i bring my car in on a sunday to replace a shred tire . i wait about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone be able to assist me and be then tell to pull my car into the shop ( that be apparently what you be suppose to do , but the big sign point you that way be for some reason keep inside the garage , so you do n\\'t see them drving up , and they purposely block the front pull - up that all other sear\\'s use ) . once inside , i have to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before -- finally -- a technician get to me . once i return to pick up my car , you can believe i spend quite a bit more time stand around wait . i have want to split the total between a credit card and check card since i be be reimburse for the tire but be tell this be n\\'t possible . once i actually get back in my car , it be dirty and have grease all over the steering wheel . ok , one bad experience ... fine . the follow friday , i return with my car to go ahead and replace the other 3 tire , which be worn . i adopt a 3.5 month old yellow lab last winter from the dumb friends league . i eventually decide to just pay the balance even though the doctor have already be pay , but now the collection agency be try to say another reversal of $ 160.00 have come through . very friendly person offer a brilliant service . cj and company do all that we ask and 10 times more . he cross examine witness relentlessly and have them break down and tell the truth . i would not have go back , but i could n\\'t find the particular tire they \\'d use in stock anywhere else . once again , i wait for quite a bit before be attend to . i get the order complete , and then question the technician since it come out about $ 40 less than i expect . he say it be the same tire , and verify this , after check both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week . however , when he print out the service quote , i could see that it be not the correct tire , and be not even an appropriate tire for my car model . so i point this out to him , at which point he say they only have one of the correct tire in stock . ok -- fine . so i get just my other rear tire replace . they promise it \\'d be do within an hour , so i wait in the lobby . over two hours later ( and ten minutes before they close ) my car be finally finish . a few minutes after i leave , i be call and inform that PUNCT i PUNCT leave my wheel lock ( which they should have leave in the car ) . of course , they would be close in 5 minutes , so i would have to hurry up or get it the next day . of course i could n\\'t make it back in time ( and they apparently could not stay 5 extra minutes to wait for me ) . the next day , no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician be not in . of course , they could n\\'t call him either to ask about it because apparently they do n\\'t keep their employee \\' phone numbers ( riiight ) , so i would have to return on monday ( drive for 3 days now with no wheel lock should i get a flat ) . on monday i call and again it be a big to - do to find anyone who know anything about it . supposedly they will be hold it for me this evening , but i \\'m sure that will also be a huge ordeal . the employee at this sear\\'s be completely apathetic and there do n\\'t seem to be any sort of management that i could see . i will never return there again ( and now have some serious doubt about the quality of work they actually perform on my car ) . pat testing quick & efficient i ring srd pat testing and within 3 hours scot have come to my premises and pat test all my our spill the whisky barn dance band equipment , and supply a certificate for only 70 p per unit . fantastic , quick and efficient service . how rare ! well do . very poor customer service . there be a couple decent person work there , but the rest be very dishonest , as well as rude , i have yet to hear the truth come out of their mouth . friendly staff , but definitely some problem may , 2009 . we be book at the sheraton with a number of other out - of - town wedding guest . get put into the wrong room the first night , and be quite surprised to have someone with the same room key try to get in the door at 1:00 am ! next day get move into another room , on the same floor with other wedding guest . there be 3 adult in our room but towel for only 2 , no linen for sofa bed . in the second room it take 3 try to get all the towel and linen we request . a package and some wedding cards be leave in our first room . they be send to our second room and have be open -- the ribbon - wrap present , and all 3 envelope . security in the hotel seem to be excellent , but we be never give an explanation as to why someone would open these item . a mid-afternoon PUNCT fire drill PUNCT be disruptive , put everyone out of the hotel . when we call the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night , it seem to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down . the staff be friendly , especially the front desk female supervisor , and seem to want to help , but too many unusual things happen to make us want to stay there again . bad service definately wo n\\'t be return . travel 40 min after call to see if a product be in stock . tell that they have plenty . get there and there be nothing . not impressed !!! a definite no incompetent server , kitchen and management . expect either undercooked or mushy food and lackluster service . the investor put big buck into the building but be clueless about what make a good dining or bar experience . even the least discriminating diner would know not to eat at sprecher \\'s . good honest wrok harlan provide great service . he be very knowledgeable and take the time to explain the repair to me . the work on my car be do quickly and i felt i could trust his work . i have nothing but fantastic things to say . i highly recommend his shop . best quote ever my gate be stuck halfway open so i call a class garage doors dr services . they come to my house in no time and start work on the gate . they be very friendly and be able to explain me exactly what be wrong with it . once they fix it they answetred all of my question with no hesitation and then give me the best quote ever . i know that if my garage door need to be repair , i will be call a class garage doors when i arrive at brickell honda on 6/4/11 , i be greet and attend to by the sales manager , gustavo guerra , in a very friendly and professional manner . i explain to him what i want and that i previously go to braman honda . bramen honda be a bit of a hassle . he tell me PUNCT no problem , we will match the offer or do better . PUNCT mr. guerra give me a better deal without any hassle nor any type of problem . brickell honda have be the best buying experience in the world . i urge all st. thomas the apostle parishioner and all of south florida resident to come see gus !!! excellent customer service !!! watch out for your wallet watch out for your wallet ! this company be overpriced for their services . they pride themselves on be an event and team building company for corporate client but you better believe they be go to mark you up on that feel good premise . on a recent event quote that i have do , they come in thousand of dollar over their local competition . the crazy part be that they be n\\'t even base locally at the city i \\'m in - they just have \\' team \\' in area through the country . i \\'ve speak to vendor who be use by them who have nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact be afraid to quote event against them even though they openly admit that they felt canadian outback be price their entertainment out of the market and do more to hurt their business than help them . be warn - they \\'ll ltake you for everything they can . tire gooroo david bundren be the tire gooroo . they really go above and beyond ! for example , i actually forget to feed my cat , and they go out of their way to take care of him . additionally , when there be confusion ( my fault ) , they leave me flower along with a personalize gift . they have be 100 % reliable and professional . definitely recommend ! we have be bless to find elite flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcard , poster , etc . we be look for a company with decent rates as our company be just get start . they have the best rates and great customer service . on one order , we need it rush and ship to a different state . i also appreciate their honesty . i send a graphic that would have be distort if print as it be . they call and work with me to fix it so that it would look perfect . they recently surprise me a larger order . i order 1000 postcard , we normally order 5000 or more . because they have room to do 5000 , they create the larger amount , and ship them early . i recommend this company to anyone and everyone that need great work do at a reasonable rate ! they have a customer for life in us ! such a great idea this be , so easy to load and pack , no ramp , no step up no back ache . very knowledgeable and friendly design build firm . they specialize in financial institution , medical , and retail project . these guy know what they \\'re do and help me in all phase of our project . this place have the best baby and child s clothes . especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just ca nt find in a lot of store . it be all very unique and you wo nt find any other baby wear the same stuff . i spend quite a bit because i spoil my little princess . ugh !!! get some nice PUNCT freshly bake PUNCT fruit square , a personal favorite of mine . take a bite , it taste odd . flip the square over and see it riddled with green mold !!!! ugh !! i call the store and the clerk giggle , and agree that it be gross , but say it be not her problem . she also refuse to get a manager . i leave my number , or try to anyway . same clerk have considerable difficulty take down a number . i \\'ll never go back there again mezza luna ftw ! their mezza luna be deffly better than the pizza roll . it seem like it s healthier too , but it s prolly not . that cut down on teh wait time , cu u can do other stuff while u r wait . their pizza be a little salty for me , but it s still good . they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layer of cheese for + 32 delicious . anyways , the mezza luna : you should try it . it run you about 4 buck and it deal crush blow to hunger . perhaps they do n\\'t deliver anymore , but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrant a pickup . you \\'ve get maids do a fabulous job clean my home . i be hire them to come once a week now that they get my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two week ! satisfactory for sure with the sercvice ! beat have one PUNCT cleaning lady PUNCT who take twice as long and do not do a very through job like the PUNCT maid PUNCT do ! from the outside ichiban look like it will be terrible . the food be amazing , and the price can not be beat . the sushi be great , and they have a great selection . quit with the overstatement ! the worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like zahav be to have too many person write hyperbolic review make claim that PUNCT everyone PUNCT be go to PUNCT love PUNCT the food , decor and service . the truth be , in my and my dining partner \\' experience , this be a fine little restaurant with some unique food . it \\'s an entirely up and down experience , however . now , the best of that unique food come at the very beginning of the meal . the salatim salad be the small plate i \\'ve ever see place in front of me ( you would most likely think they be condiment if it be n\\'t explain to you ) . though they be mostly excellent , you generally do n\\'t get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them . that be say , the laffa and hummus be out of this world . then again , for the three of us who dine together , two piece of flatbread leave us fight for more , and lick the hummus from our finger ( and yes , those two piece of flatbread do represent a three - person order ) . dinner be also an up - and - down experience . the vegetarian dish and light fare be almost always spot - on , while the lamb be often dry and / or overcooked . the duck be a 65 % glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy , crispy delicacy it usually represent at other establishment . dessert be ... hmmm , that \\'s interesting , i do n\\'t even remember dessert . i guess that tell you a lot . oh , yes , the chocolate semifreddo be quite good . and my -- no , i still do n\\'t remember what i have . service be average , but nothing special , and restaurant that be suppose to be excellent should do a better job of train their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly , not merely capable . perhaps have we not go into this restaurant believe zahav be go to be golden as it name suggest ( and as the many golden review seem to attest ) , we would have enjoy a decent little expensive experience . but one should not go here expect something fantastic , unless perhaps you \\'ve never have middle - eastern food before , or succulent duck , tasty lamb , decent portion size or actually warm chocolate dessert . do they think we be go to feel lucky to get any reservation at all , and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience ? find another place run down . dark , dark main room . no way to read / relax . \\' electric \\' blanket on one bed do not heat . quite cold . remove 90 % of \\' sit - abouts \\' in main room would look clean . food be always good really amazing the new and exciting play do at this theatre ! no service .. but good food .. surprisingly , this little strip mall restaurant have the best sushi i \\'ve find in the tampa area . it \\'s fresh and really tasty . i \\'ll drive an hour just for their volcano , yum ! outstanding service & quality at a very affordable price ! this place be top notch and highly affordable ! i would recommend it hands down and be a loyal customer . i \\'ve also send over a number of friend to use the services here and everyone be extraordinarily pleased ! thanks for do such great work on my important piece of clothing that always look great ! extremely helpful and professional as first - time home buyer , my husband and i find stephanie fairchild at prudential steamboat realty , extremely helpful . she work with us for over a year , help us find our perfect home . stephanie \\'s knowledge of the market and property in our price range , make us feel secure in our decision to buy when we do . we would highly recommend stephanie to anyone look for a home in the yampa valley . we appreciate her patience , knowledge and kindness ! one of a few . hancocks be one of four fabric store in fort smith . we have hobby lobby , just for fun fabrics , walmart , and interior mall just inside barling . they do have a good selection of fabric and notion . the company get busy but you never have to wait long because they be orginizied , so you be in , out , and pay well for your scrap favorite place in tampa . update : i have to add to my review . i be just in last night and have a chance to dine in their new dining room . amazing ! i frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch . well i be in for a treat when i be greet by the friendly girl at the counter who ask if my wife and i would like to sit in their PUNCT new PUNCT dining room . right away they tell us that it be the same great food with the same price so off we go . we be greet again and sit promptly . after look at the menu and see the new menu item they have , we know we be in for a treat ! i have the chicken parmesan dinner and my wife have the shrimp scampi dinner . amazing ! the portion be generous enough that we even take some home ! i have to say the value of this place always amaze me . it \\'s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that have upscale service , amazing atmosphere , and incredible food , but not break the bank while enjoy it ! bottom line be that when it \\'s a small privatly own resturant like this be you can tell that the owner and employee take pride in their product and service . well do ! use their service for the first time and be immediately impress by their professionalism ( receive a phone call soon after order be place to confirm details ) and the subsequent delivery of my gift ( to split , croatia ) be as request . the gift itself be exactly as describe and picture in the catalogue and of the high standard . would highly recommend to anyone require overseas gift delivery . danny ( australia ) give them a try ! the pizza be huge and super delicious . they \\'re our favorite pizza place to order from ... and they \\'re a local , family own company ! how much better do it get ?! we be expect a great experience , when we recieved a friendly greeting by the host . the atmosphere be nice and very clean . the menu have plenty of option even for picky eater . the service be ok , our waitress keep forget our drink even though we remind her several times . to start we try the guacamole and salsa verde , it be completly flavorless . we should have leave then . we orderd our meal anyway , chimichangas , jalapeno borritos , and quesadilla . everything be bland , completely void of any spice or flavor . we have never have mexican food this bad , it be just simply gross . over-rated ... this restaurant be over-rated . it be hard to find ... and the mexican food be bland , almost equivalent to eat out of a can . the service be poor ... i ask for a fry egg on my enchilada ... and do not get it .! secondly , the enchladas do not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like hormel \\'s chili .. the cheese be american cheese ! the chili relleno .. have no batter on it . wife and i attempt to adopt a dog and be nothing but frustrating . we be tell that we could n\\'t today because they be close soon . i call the next morning to let then know my wife would be drive in . they give me the run around and miss paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else want her and i would need to come in and put down a deposit . i work 2 hours away but offer my card over the phone . they refuse . terrible communication as well . at one point they tell me the dog have be fix , the next day it have n\\'t . huge ammount of time waste time and elevate blood pressure . want a great burger ? the smokehouse ca n\\'t be beat anywhere . salad bar be hit and miss for freshness - sometimes the broccoli look browned around the edge . never a bad smokehouse burger though ! i crave those . best chinese restaurant ever !!! it be the best chinese food i have ever have . all the food taste excellent , and with the new renovation of chair and the bathroom , it be awesome . the person work their be also extremely polite and friendly . every time i go , kevin , the manager , will always remember my family and i . overall , it be very family oriented , and i recommend it to everyone !!! poor experience i do not have a good experience w / dr. ghassemlou . during the session , he demand to have my physical address , which i \\'ve always keep private as i be enrol in a witness protection program . i believe he be correct in that he need my physical address for legal reason , however , he do not adequately explain this during our session . i think he could \\'ve do more to assuage my concern by give me concrete fact . say that i need to give him my address or else i have intimacy issue be not helpful . it \\'s pretty combative actually . buyer beware do not use these guy . they \\'ll tell you one thing then $ 5,000 later do another . lie right to my face then deny it . run away . it \\'s fine for ... it \\'s fine for mass - market chocolate , but with company like scharffen berger , tcho , and smaller artisan chocolate maker in the area , why ? good food , good location , and good price . but the server do n\\'t pay attention to you whether it \\'s busy or not . i find bright star tours and travels and best and affordable tour operators and tours agents in chennai , india offer me student tour india package for very less price . i enjoy my tour and i be look for adventure tour and india heritage tours for valuable . thanks for bright star tours . slice pizza at former britt \\'s location britt \\'s pizza be long gone . their location , the northwest corner of s. 10th & federal sts. , be now home to slice pizza . responsive , keep me apprised of status . spot on this kebab shop be one of the best around the meat be good and fresh and the chilly sauce be the best , keep them lovely kebab come and a happy new year to all the staff the waiting staff be really friendly , it s like every one know each other , the manager be really sweet and the food .. well no complaint from me . yes , it s that good . feel good i just want to try your clinic because i be not totally happy with my current therapist i regularly see . now i \\'ve find someone who can manage to do what i really want . the staff leave a lot to be desire . the front staff have see quite a bit of turnover and change from professional to rude . a simple follow - up phone call with a woman quickly turn into a nightmare . she may be the reason for all the change . i sincerely wonder if the doctor have a clue about what be go on within his practice . if he do know and approve of this behavior then it be a poor reflection on him . sometimes it be not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor . he be an okay doctor but not worth her . food - very good for a midnight meal that be n\\'t fast food . service - the worker be usually pleasant . atmosphere be always fun , the assortment of customer add entertainment to the meal nice little locally own greek bar and grill . good food . great wings ! she have take care of my sweet girl for almost 4 years now and i would not let gracee go with anyone besides her !!! pure beauty what a joy to stroll off historic canyon road in santa fe into a gallery with a gorgeous diversity of art . destiny allison \\'s metal sculpture be my favorite . the owner karla be welcoming and fun . give yourself the gift of visit winterowd fine art !

i will never go to another vet as long as i have animal . i live nearly two hours away and yet i will still make the drive to see them ! in fact i look forward to take my animal to the vet simply because of how my animal and i be treat . you will be happy at this store ! allen tire be recommend by friend after my have bad tire experience in temecula . the store manager , jim smith , make an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquire lexus . tire be the right price and now the car feel like it be ride on rails around turn . the store be clean , run very professionally and a pleasure to be in . they know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything be do right . we be very pleased with the services of first glass window . our window pane be so dirty that they need a specialist to come and clean them . we call few company before we decide to hire them . they come on time and complete their work quickly . we be very happy how clean look our windows . if you have some problem with your windows , you should call them . a ++ they be by far the best salon in 50 mile , trust me i know !! excellent ! answer all my question , and call me back when i need something . highly recommend ! poor service if you like the drama describe in popular sitcom \\' seinfeld \\' , you will see it here . we sign our name in about 6:00 pm . there be 3 names before us . the greeter say there be about 15 minutes waiting . however , we wait and wait and in the mean time , see 4 group of person simply just parade in without sign there names . this sign in policy be post by the restaurant PUNCT no reservation , sign your name here PUNCT . i have to ask the greeter , he explain his reason with broken english . i could not understand any his reason . i could only take it as they would seat the person they know first . my conclusion be that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kind other person be seat before you . you guy do everything wonderful ! we honestly can not think of even 1 thing we do n\\'t like ! my favorite cuban cafe in orlando i have be eat cuban for a long time , sandwich mainly along with other dish .. i love cuban coffee , colada ... mmmm anyways i find this place and ca n\\'t stop go there , i stop in at least once a week and anytime i \\'m in the area for a cuban coffee or snack . the place be chill and comfortable . they do n\\'t speak the best english but enough to get by . they bake bread fresh daily , they do n\\'t press their sandwich which be the way i like it , and the meat be always fresh . they have a great lunch special with your choice of meat , chicken , steak , or pork and rice and black bean and fry plantain . and their breakfast be awesome !! i can not describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastry and the omelet be to die for . stop in and have a bite you wo n\\'t regret it . a slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth ! i really want to like this place since i work right around the corner . unfortunately , i \\'ve give it a couple of try at different times and decide to stop go . the employee do n\\'t really seem to enjoy what they be do and it show . this place be clean and well run with great person . the food be fresh and taste great . great value and service . we will be back again and again !! perfect practice after i have choose the fountain dental practice they provide a slick and professional service from start to finish . everyone be friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself , put me at my ease and explain the whole process , both initially and then as we go along . surgery visit timing be always make to suit me and not them and they give me the feeling that i matter and be important to them . the surgery itself be slick , modern and very relaxed and i always felt that i be in capable hands . my dental surgeon , dr. lucy nichols be clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she do and the reputation she have establish . everyone be so helpful that i can not wait to go back ..... peter only concerned with money i have be get my treatment for a few month now and have see some result but not up to the standard that i be tell i should expect . the person there attempt to come across and professional and nice , but i be disappointed with their customer service . never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment , even if you have an emergency . it \\'s pretty ridiculous ! they want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just get in a car accident !!!! they do n\\'t care one bit about you !!!!! dr. strzalka at flagship cvts be not a good doctor i be not sure about the quality of the other doctor there , but i do know from personal experience that dr. christopher t. strzalka be not a man of his word , and be also very cruel and uncaring !! he be go to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis . i have a surgery date of july 17 , 2008 . then he renigged when he read my health care proxy , even though i agree to be on the ventilator for 2 month follow surgery ( as he have twice state i must agree to ) . he later say that by 2 month he PUNCT mean at least two month PUNCT . two month and at least two month be totally different things . he do not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer , which i would have . a health care proxy be not write in stone and can be change . he also never even say he be sorry . just say i be inoperable and walk out of the hospital room . so , therefore , now he say i be inoperable ( even though i be not 100 % inoperable ) , and he be let me die . i be just middle aged and do not want to die , but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternative . i , along with my friend , consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he be not even try to save my life by operate . even my pa i go to the other day say PUNCT it must by comforting to have go to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you PUNCT . he say it sarcastically . if you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind , and not know what he be talk about when he recommend procedure at other hospital and say they be what you need , when they will not work for you , go to this doctor ... he be the one for you . ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget . me and my dad where in nj for a kc chiefs ( my home team ) v the ny jets and for game 4 of the world series . i \\'m a red sox fan so i be glad that the phillies win . the knights inn be small very small . i mean 1 room in every room ! it be cozy a little and a small tv . i mean a 2 day stay be a ok stay even tho the manager look like he be chineze and that we only sleep and go out from 8 to 7 to see new york . but sice we almost just sleep there i ca nt give that good of a review review on house of joy chinese restaurant my family and i move to san antonio a year ago and have try almost all of the chinese restaurant because we love chinese food . well it take us a while to find one that we like . but we do n\\'t just like house of joy we love it . everything we have get there have be more authentic and better taste than any other chinese restaurant in the san antonio area we have be to -- and trust me we have be to a lot of them . we just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we have to visit the bexar county tax office off of bandera road . we stop in and get some take out and can not stop go back . they have the best egg drop soup i have ever taste . we also love their egg roll and spring roll . and every entree we have order be perfect . everything be always cook fresh and taste fresh . their price be extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive . the staff be also just so pleasant to deal with . they be also quick at get your order out to you . you do n\\'t have to sit and wait around forever like most place !! so anyone look for an excellent night out for chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because i promise you 2 things --- you wo n\\'t regret it !! and you will go back for more !!! karla ferguson - granger ps i have notice on here that someone leave a comment that PUNCT all of the nice comment must come from co worker or friend PUNCT and i will tell you that i do n\\'t know these person except from eat at their restaurant . we be from virginia and just move here a year ago . so that comment be completely false . because we think it \\'s the best !!!

stay away ! can ever & never forget the training undergo here which make my life step onto the successful job without any hurdles . the staff , material provide , infra structure , environment & low fee totally above the satisfactory mark the decor leave a lot to be desire and the poster tell me all the reason 99 be great just serve as an ironic contrast against the reality . i love this place lots of person to talk to and school be across the street ! andrew be helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re : infertility . there \\'s a restaurant nearby ( walking distance ) with a great breakfast , and a market across the street . the family suite be basically two rooms with a small opening between them which work great for us because we be two family travel together . however , now that i have come to realize that i be go to owe the irs $ 6,000 + despite do exactly what rod tell me to do , i feel i have to voice my opinion . ~ it take over 40 min to be take to our table , once there it take another 20 min to get our order and a further 45 min till our starter land on our table . very frustrating for a restaurant that have 1 rosette and be supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm there be no canape or amuse to keep us occupied , once we complain about the wait they take us something to nibble on but that take us get out our chair and wonder round to do that and it be impossible to get anyone s attention . on top of that though they try to charge us service charge just to rub it it .... right near chelan . they have be my only PUNCT go - to PUNCT resource since we first do business together . outside of parking be at a premium , especially on discount days , the laundry tub be not filthy and it \\'s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromat i \\'ve be in . the beer be good , nice choice of beer as well , and as usual the mussel be great , the place upstairs be a nice addition to the bar downstairs . fill up on too much beer and hence can not comment on the food . worst experience ever like a sardine can and the bartender downstairs be the rude person i have ever meet . he be my mechanic go forward ! it be next to gare du nord and a five minute walk to sacre coeur which be excellent for shopping . it all have to do with the sales guy which be a young 22 year old who have admittedly only be work for 2 week . i do n\\'t know if the kid have a bad day or what , but i have to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he drop the issue . i work with andrew for 2 month and do acupuncture and herb . a large group of my friend and i rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend , and the experience and stay have always be five - star . i personally trust this midas store with all my vehicle , i have be go there for years & would never go anywhere else ! i fucking hate this place every time i go this hot chick show up and i mean really hot but she be like reaaaally dumb and then their be this other chick that be realy ugly but she be like super smart she could be a scientist , but then their be this stoner who always come here high and he always bring his fucking dog who be so high from the second hand smoke i think he be try to talk . with all the child predator out there , a busy road , car speed by ...... and you be go to let some 4 / 5 year old wonder around cause you \\'re money hungry ? i phone this company for advice on our office refurb and although we do not use them in the end ( as our building contractor carry out the electrical work ) , they provide me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we be now use pjc as our electrical maintenance contractor . they do a very bad job with my hair and be extremely rude when i go back to ask them why it do n\\'t work for my hair . i think this place be probably really great especially judge by the review on here . remember to ask for extra vege the portion be generous and we get out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant . if you be in town and need that kind of space i say stay here but if you be look for a little more upscale affair do n\\'t let the picture fool you and book somewhere else . i expect to pay for this service , but imagine my surprise when i receive a bill for more than what i pay to have the original return prepare . i have use them four times for fix item from push out a dent in a bumper to fix the fender on my beloved miata . we visit on 7/26/08 for dinner we receive a gift certificate for the mama mia \\'s on greenfield ave . sorry for interrupt i guess .

PUNCT the service be just about as good as i \\'d get in nyc ( that mean it be poor ) and the food be almost mediocre . for instance i ask who own mazda and he say with confidence that be gm , which be n\\'t true . this shop be by far the best i have be to . # 2 the decor be tasteful and artistic , from the comfortable chair to the elegant light fixture .... and ( most importantly ) # 3 the food be fantastic . and we buy a few cookie there too , they be fantastic as well ! ) i do n\\'t want to waste my time on route set for child , but i do n\\'t want to take on something i ca n\\'t handle just to strain myself to exhaustion . again , a great outing for the kid , a frustration for an out of town climber . would n\\'t go back as there be a lot of place a lot better and cheap . by the way , salmagundi ( the store name ) mean something like smorgasbord ; potpourri ; motley ; variety ; mix bag ; miscellaneous assortment ; mixture , a variety of many kind of things . comfortable and clean bed , a bit noisy when person be come in late from a night out , but we do n\\'t mind too much as we be also just come in from a night out ! it be worth of the ride more than an hour ... it be my birthday and i have a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one pre-made in a convenience store , but the problem be it be the day before valentine s and when many bakery turn me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake , fiona step up to the plate and be able to make a fantastic beautiful cake . ask why , rod simply tell me that he have to research how to do the amendment ( it be an amended to show that i have purchase a home - nothing out of the ordinary , one would think ) and that take time to figure out . favorite dd spot in the area !

this be nothing like new york style pizza !!!. i love pizza and this be a complete and utter disappointment !! i would not suggest this pizza to anyone !!! one suspect that earlier reviewer work for another laundry . yes , there be bigger , but bigger be n\\'t necessarily better . i avail myself of the wash \\'n fold service , take just about a year \\'s worth of dirty clothes in and get back neatly fold , clean clothes in clear plastic bag ( i \\'d originally bring them in , in six large yellow garbage bag ) . the cost be certainly reasonable and i will continue my patronage of the laundry tub in the future . will never use again . very rude and unprofessional . the worker speed up and down the street with no mind to the small child play . professional good job very professional . it make me feel good to see person work so hard to take care of others belongings . these guy do great work at very reasonable price . i have never be disappoint . speak english rushi best place to sleep !!!!!!!

PUNCT eulogic good place to be on a sunday night . but the menu have standard stuff that one would get at a belgian tavern . if you be a handcraft beer person , this be a fantastic place to be . do not go to this salon , especially if you have to get your hair straighten . i mean , i do n\\'t care if he do n\\'t know , but if he pretend to know and tell me bs to my face , there \\'s no way i \\'m go to trust him when matter turn to the price of the car and financing . when have your car work on you have to trust the mechanic & this midas be truly someone you can trust ! i be n\\'t go to use them again , but i be go to leave it at that . i really enjoy meet her and happy to learn she come from oklahoma and have the values of a solid no bs country girl . i play dumb and ask him question that i already know the answer to and he respond with half truth and a few falsehood . not only do it taste wonderful , but the texture be unbelievable , the frosting be n\\'t overly sweet to over power the cake , and the cake itself be just amazingly soft , and fluffy , and just perfect overall . tourist like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality , but i certainly do . i typically have work do on my jeep at the dealership , but it be 6 years old now and get charge dealership price just do n\\'t seem cost effective anymore .

they be honest about \\' immediate \\' concern versus \\' recommend \\' repair and have very fair price . i hate to say check them out just for the salsa , but james , i need another jar badly :) all kidding aside , they be a very good company , i have a hard time give any service biz a 5 star review but they come close . the apartment across from mine belong to a gang of hooker . they tell me that this be not under warranty and want to charge me $ 175 just to diagnose the problem ! seem like all they care about be the money and get home on time , no care for the customer at all !!! while there be n\\'t too much available for their age ( ball pit , bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on ) , we go right when they open at 10 am on a winter weekday and end up be the only one there , so we be give a little more liberty than we would have if others have be there . we be stand in the store for 20 minutes to simply pick up an order . try crust on broad on 3 occasions . it be the real thing - i have be practice pilates for over 7 years and would not go anywhere else . i call on a friday at 12:30 complain of a severe toothache . dr. obina tell me that his office close at noon and that i should call him on monday . i have be a patient of dr. olbina for 9 years and have spend thousand of dollar on crown etc . this can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone add cross boarder for the first time . i have be go to warner family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone . cathy ****** five star for lake forest tots . the program have be a postive experience for my child . i need a part for my appliance , the cost be very high so i say never mind , pay the fee and call a local business for a second quote . very disappointed in kitchen aid as well , i think that they pre-screened their vendor for price and quality of work , obviously they do not ! i congratulate this establishment for do the research on make nyc pizza because these scots fcking nail it . it be a little to high dollar for me anyone else find it a little suspicious that there be not only 20 review for this dentist ( a huge number compare to the others in the area ) , but that they all have the same unique grammar structure ? 45 p for tap water ! clean rooms , great for the price and cheap on the exit . thanks for the great care !!!! i ca nt speak for them but any test or appointment they recommend be probably in the best interest of us ( the patient ) and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you . i personally have have wonderful service and if you re truely look for a family practice ... warner family be the place for you . she ask for the dinner combo and they give her two dinner plate instead . you have to bring in your own model and they have to pay for you to use them if you do nt then you can graduate ! the staff will not even answer the phone for take out . great meat that be already cook , easy to take home for dinner . and the salsa , be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around , you will need them ..... parking space be just big enough for a mini cooper . thank you again for great customer service !

they also get my friend s order mix up and want to charger her $ 10 more than what she have want . they have a great selection of wine from all over the world with all different price . instead of reschedule they choose to waste my time instead . the worst chinese i \\'ve ever have the service stink . they be abrasive and rude - when they be the one who mess everything up . the only thing that be edible be the steam rice and the vegetable lo mein be barely tolerable . i will never go here again . lucky panda in willis be a billion times better in service and quality of the meal . i have no idea how china delight win number 1 chinese restaurant in montgomery - there need to be a recount on that vote . rude and untrustworthy they be especially rude to woman . do not trust them ! college be a joke and the salon be a joke ! go to the school here over priced !!!!!! you do not learn the things you be promise . staff be under educated . over priced for student to learn ! beware of the nail program you be not teach to use a nail drill at all you learn the old fashioned way of do nail you will not be able to do well in a salon !!!
