# multiword_expression_detection
Word embedding and statistical analyzer (Chi-square, maximum likelihood, log likelihood, student's t distribution, point wise mutual information) approach used. \n\n
1. Layered feedforward network.ipynb == use layered feedforward neural network with Word Embeddings
2. traditional machine learning.ipynb == use KNN, random forest, logistic regression, gradient boosting, support vector machine on Word Embeddings
3. journal 2.ipynb == use random forest on statistical analyzer approach
